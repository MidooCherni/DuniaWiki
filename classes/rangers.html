<p>Hermits who use cunning, deftness and the environment as their greatest weapon. They harness their great speed and agility to outrun any potential match and turn the tides of battle in their favor. Where others see agoraphobic fields and oppressively vast expanses, Rangers see the opportunity to tame their surroundings and utilize them for their own advantage.</p>
  <p>What sets Rangers apart from others is their resourcefulness; as skilled and patient hunters, they revel in non-conventional life on the frontier, and find themselves at home where others would be estranged. They are adept trackers, taking particular pleasure in chasing quarry that has been made into helpless prey thanks to the Ranger's clever use of terrain and circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>They get to choose 1 new talent at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 19, but may not exceed 20 in any stat this way until after level 20. They add 3/4 of their level to each attack diminishingly (75%/50%/25%)</p>
  <p>Plate armor disables their abilities, with the exception of the Engineer's specific subclass abilities. Rangers have advantage on Search skill rolls, +4 Hide, +4 Acrobacy, +4 Escape, +4 Knowledge (Nature)
  </p>
  <p><b>Level 4:</b> Rangers are endowed with the ability to <em>track a target</em> they have seen before using clues in the environment. The DC to track a target is in 5 in lush, busy or messy places like forests, plains, clogged mineshafts, 10 indoors, 15 on hard surfaces like a rock mesa, and 20 across a body of water. The Ranger may attempt to track once per hour, and if successful can sense where their target went, and how long ago.</p>
  <p><b>Level 8:</b> Rangers become particularly adept at <em>evading effects</em>. Successfully resisting a spell nullifies its effects entirely rather than halving or reducing them.</p>
  <p><b>Level 12:</b> Rangers may <em>camouflage themselves</em> in any natural terrain, becoming functionally invisible as if by spell. They also become completely immune from physical restraint such as rope or manacles.</p>
  <p><b>Level 16:</b> Rangers may <em>hide in plain sight</em>, meaning they can slip into foliage or shadow or some other method of concealment even while being watched. Rangers also gain total <em>blindsight</em> up to 30 ft</p>
