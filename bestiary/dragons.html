<br><h2><a href="creatures.html">Bestiary</a> > Dragons</h2>
      <p>In the world of Dunia, true Dragons are ancient beings that exist outside the cosmic dichotomy of light and shadow. They are manifestations of pure and unfettered chaos in a way that transcends the moral definition of chaos. Chaos, to a being so ancient as to define it on a natural level, is freedom. It is irregularity, abnormality and the unexpected; the ability for irrational life to flourish in a mathematically dead universe. Chaos is the existence of life, love, emotion, free will and surprises that don't make sense if one observes the world on a theoretical level. Chaos is the power negligible sub-decimals have to distort the outcomes of a calculation from its expected values. That is the power that birthed the world out of the perfection of nothingness, starting with the first sentient and thinking race: the Dragons.</p>
    <p>There are four kinds of true Dragons in the world of Dunia, each the children of the Dragon King's four daughters: Red or Fire Dragons represent fire, passion, drive, conquest, energy, and the benevolence of destroying to make way for the new. Black or Dark Dragons represent insanity, rage, malice, fear, despair, ego and trickery, to which one surrenders if their goal becomes too important to check their own morals. Gold or Earth Dragons represent strategy, memory, construction, craftsmanship, machinery and creativity. Silver or Storm Dragons represent nobility, regality, mercy, treatise, ceasefire and alliance. All of them are intelligent and completely immune to fire.</p>
      <p>After the fall of the Dragon King, many Dragons have adapted to life in different parts of the world, and begat offspring of unorthodox colors. Hence water dragons, metal dragons, gem dragons, green dragons and dragon turtles roamed the earth. Aberrations and lesser Dragons are Draconic, but chimeric beings such as Draktaur and Dragonkin are not.</p><br>
