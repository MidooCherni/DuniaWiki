<h2>Appendix - Land Management</h2>
<p>        Some characters will stumble their way into land ownership one way or another. Knights naturally have access to a plot of land within an area controlled by their faction at the time once they attain a certain level, but anyone with enough wealth or the favor of nobles will find themselves the proud owner of a stretch of ground they're free to do anything on. The most common thing for a land-owner to do with their newfound symbol of wealth is to erect some kind of building. A home, a palace, an inn, or the like.</p>
  <p>        In Dunia, an adventurer's house is their stable home in the world, which takes a while and a sum of money to commission the building of, but will reward a high-level player and their allies with adequate bonuses on their adventure.</p>
  <p>        <b>Building: </b>A home will take a number of days and a sum of money to build depending on its nature and size category, and will be appropriately taxed per year for a 1/5th of its value. Taxes allow for the local lord of wherever the home is built to come to the landowner's rescue in the event of some kind of attack as well as maintaining road infrastructure to and from highways and towns. One can eschew taxes by building in total wilderness, but will have to fend off attacks themselves, and all land surrounding it will be difficult. Free land granted to Knights is exempt from taxation, and Priests can declare their homes as an untaxed place of worship.</p><br>
