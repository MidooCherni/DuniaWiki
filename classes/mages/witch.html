<img src="witch.jpg" class="racepic" style="width:30%">
<p>Chaotic only. Also known as Warlock, Demonologist or Occultist. A reclusive dark oracle who makes conditional covenants with incomprehensible outer gods and demons from the abyss in exchange for a wealth of unholy power.</p>
  <p>Unlike the impersonal natural arcane employed by other Mages, the font from which demonologists derive their power is immeasurably dangerous and unpredictable. A burgeoning Witch is usually chosen by the Abyss for their innate traits, though tales of bold and enterprising Mages power-hungry enough to choose this path themselves aren't unheard of. Their tale usually begins with their appropriation of one of the rare and forbidden books that detail the history of preceding occultists and the methods with which they have found success in contacting Abyssal spirits (pentagrams, sacrifices, rituals), as well as intimate knowledge of their nature and desires.</p>
  <p>Witches do not use spell slots, unlike other mages. They tap into a powerful metaphysical resource called Mana.</p>
  <p><b>Level 1: </b>Witches can cast the <em>find familiar</em> spell at no cost or cooldown. They can also <em>grimdark blast</em> creatures with a death beam that converts raw mana into Shadow damage at a rate of 1:1 at Ld6 points per turn. If their mana runs out, they may drain their own health to continue dealing damage. Creatures can dodge the initial projectile, but must roll standard CHA Shadow spell resist every turn to break free.</p>
  <p><b>Level 4: </b>Witches can form a <em>Sealing Pentagram</em>, which functions like a Great Hold spell with advantage against demons. They gain the ability to <em>summon 4 types of spirits</em> by drawing a circle of runes in chalk, surrounding it with four candles, that obey appropriate commands until the Witch loses concentration or dismisses them from servitude:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Labor Slave: </b>By sacrificing a dismembered creature of 12 STR value or higher, the Witch can summon a demon of Strength value 12 + their INT modifier, which performs any physical task (breaking doors, carrying) but will refuse to fight.</li>
    <li><b>Knowledge Djinn: </b>By sacrificing 1,000 gold worth of jewelry in the circle, the Witch can summon an elemental spirit which can see anything happening anywhere in the world (provided that place isn't protected from Divination), and will answer any question.</li>
    <li><b>Messenger Daemon: </b>By sacrificing one hundred feather quills or the mane and heart of a stallion, the Witch can call a teleporting Demon which carries any object or message.</li>
    <li><b>Guardian Daemon: </b>By sacrificing a living sentient person, the Witch can summon any Daemon of rank equal to half their current level to fight for them. This spell is guaranteed to last for one minute for every person sacrificed, after which the Witch must find a way to banish the Daemon or allow it to roll d20s against their CHA every level to try to break control and turn on their summoner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Level 8: </b>Witches gain <em>immunity from poison</em>, and their own blood grows <em>poisonous</em>. A particularly wronged Witch may abandon themselves to the Abyss and <em>go grimdark</em>, halving their WIS and CON to enter a trance state of pure rage that increases the power of their death beam up to 2:1 ratio @d12 (3:1@d20 at 16), allowing them to strike multiple targets at once (with respectively increased cost), causing them to burn black and lose the ability to speak any language but Abyssal for the duration. They fall unconscious after the target of their ire is neutralized. WIS and CON are restored at a rate of 1 point per day.</p>
  <p><b>Level 12: </b>Witches may <em>sacrifice</em> a living being to curse or bless any item, modifying its enchantment level up to +/-3 one time per day. They may also force the sacrifice's soul to <em>haunt</em> another living being's body.</p>
  <p><b>Level 16: </b>Witches can <em>alter fate</em> to force a roll to try again once per 4 levels daily. They can also <em>commune with the abyss</em> every time they go to sleep, receiving helpful messages pertaining to their quest.</p><br>
