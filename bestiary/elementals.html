<br><h2><a href="creatures.html">Bestiary</a> > Elementals</h2>
  <p>Direct manifestations of the elemental powers of magic that permeate the multiverse: Fire, Frost, Air, Earth, Life and Water. These beings are not divinely created by any higher power, and rather coalesce into life out of the independent semi-sentience of the Draconic chaos attempting to protect itself and its most loyal defenders.</p>
  <p>Elementals are generally immune to their own element.</p><br>
