<p> <b><center>ABJURATION - Protection</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Arcane Lock</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using 25gp of gold dust, which the spell consumes, the caster tightly seals a door or any door-like formation with a DC of 10 + caster level to pick (Open Lock) or break down (STR).</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>CONJURATION - Transportation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Fire Sphere</b> - Conjuration, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster summons a 5 foot sphere of explosive fire which causes 2d4 Fire damage to any creature within, with an extra +1d4 for each slot level above the 2nd. A successful spell AGI saving throw means the target managed to get out in time to only take half damage.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Spinning Daggers</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster creates a 5 foot cube of spinning daggers which cause 2d4 physical damage to any creature within, with an extra +1d4 for each slot level above the 2nd. It lingers for 1 minute provided the caster maintains concentration.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Web</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster covers a 20 foot wide area with spiderwebs. Any creatures within must roll STR vs DC 10 + the caster's level or be completely stuck each round. The web is flammable, dealing 2d4 damage if ignited.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>DIVINATION - Unnatural Sight</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Detect Thoughts</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster can try to worm their way into the mind of an unsuspecting creature and read their current thoughts. The target feels nothing but a slight kind of pressure. The caster can try to probe their thoughts by silently asking questions and hearing the ensuing thought. The caster can also use this ability on themselves in order to detect nearby creatures, being able to then re-cast it on any of the detected targets without having to spend another slot.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Sense Object</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a forked twig, the caster can sense the location of an object they can visualize within their mind's eye or describe with reasonable accuracy. This spell fails if the object is separated from the caster by any thickness of lead; even a thin sheet.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - See Invisible</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a small sprinkle of powdered silver, the caster gains the ability to see invisible creatures as well as spirits and ghosts of the dead for up to one hour.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>ENCHANTMENT - Mind-Addling</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Suggestion</b> - Enchantment, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using the forked tongue of a snake, the caster can speak one sentence to a target of their choice who is willing to hear them out and improve their reaction. The caster speaks in a way that seems reasonable to the target regardless of whether a demand they make would be against their best interest. The target will obviously not obey dangerous commands, and any proof that the caster is lying will immediately snap them awake from the effect.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>EVOCATION - Energy Generation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Acid Shot</b> - Evocation, Nature/Toxin</p>
 <p>The caster mimics the act of an archer drawing an arrow, shooting a shot of steaming serpentine acid to fly toward the target with the same DEX calculation as a ranged attack. If the shot lands, it deals 2d4 Nature/Toxin damage initially, and 2d4 again after the victim takes an action. When cast at a higher slot level, this spell does an extra 1d4 damage for each slot level on both the initial and delayed hit.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Darkness</b> - Evocation, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster causes a 15 foot area to enter total darkness which is impenetrable even to creatures endowed with darkvision for up to 10 feet. Only magical light of equal slot level or higher to what this spell is cast in can illuminate through it. The darkness can be attached to an object and move along with it.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Gust of Wind</b> - Evocation, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>Also affectionately known as "windy thing". For up to one minute, the caster can force a strong gust of wind 10 feet wind to blast in any direction, throwing creatures that fail a STR check on their back and 15 feet away. The area is considered difficult terrain until the end of the effect. This gust extinguishes natural fires of any kind. As a bonus action, the caster can change the wind's direction.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Numbing Ice</b> - Evocation, Frost</p>
 <p>A blast of cold emanates in a 30 foot cone from the caster's hand, forcing all creatures caught within to roll CON or take 2d4 + 1d4 for each slot level above the 2nd in Frost damage. Successful save halves damage. The terrain is turned into difficult terrain for the next round for each creature that fails the save roll.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Scorching Whip</b> - Evocation, Fire</p>
 <p>A whip of pure fire materializes in the caster's hand which does not hurt them. They may crack the whip to spread it into a straight line of 30 feet in length, which forces everything in its path to roll AGI or endure 3d6 damage +1d6 for each slot level above the 2nd. A successful save halves damage.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Shatter Space</b> - Evocation, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>The caster does a sudden movement of their hand, forcing a 10 foot wide space of air in front of them to erupt with a sudden pressure. Any creatures caught in the area must roll CON or take 1d6 damage. A successful save halves damage taken. Inorganic things not being worn or carried are damaged.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Smoldering Stones</b> - Evocation, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster coalesces three pebbles of white-hot fire which do not hurt them. They may spend a main action to throw all three stones at any number of targets, with each dealing 2d6 damage. Casting this spell at a higher slot level creates one more stone per level above the 2nd.</p>
  <br><p> <b><center>ILLUSION - False Sensation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Blur Image</b> - Illusion, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster makes their image appear blurry and shift around, causing any attackers going for them to have disadvantage, except those that do not rely on sight such as those with blindsight or truesight.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Invisibility</b> - Illusion, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster renders themselves and anything they're wearing or carrying invisible as long as it remains on them. This spell ends for any target that attacks or casts a spell. If this spell is cast at a higher slot level, the caster can target 1 more creature per level above 2nd.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Light Clones- Illusion, Arcane</p>
 <p>Three mirror images of the caster appear nearby, mimicking their exact movements and lasting for up to one minute. If the caster is subject to an attack and fails to dodge, they roll a d20 and only take damage if the result is lower than what follows for each of the following situations: </b>6 if three clones are up, 8 if two, and 11 if one. If a light clone is hit, it disperses immediately. Recasting the spell refreshes the count.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Phantasm</b> - Illusion, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster implants the phantasm of an object or creature in the mind of a target that lasts for up to 1 minute, who must roll for WIS against the spell or believe it is fully real. The phantasm is so vivid that the target's mind rationalizes any illogical behavior, such as believing a phantasmal bridge was moved by the wind if they tried to walk across it and fell. Each turn, the victim takes 1d6 Shadow damage.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Record Voice*</b> - Illusion, Arcane</p>
 <p>An object chosen by the caster remembers up to ten minutes of speech, preparing to sprout a magical mouth and replay them again when a specific trigger event happens.

 <br><p> <b><center>NECROMANCY - Decay</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Sensory Loss</b> - Necromancy, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster forces a target they can see to roll CON to resist or be blinded or deafened (up to the caster) for up to one minute.

 <br><p><b>2 - Transfer Life</b> - Necromancy, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster chooses a 10 foot radius area in which every target must roll CON or take 2d6 + 1d6 for each slot above the 2nd this spell is cast in as Shadow damage (half on a successful save). Plants in that area wither. They can use the energy taken to restore an amount of health to another target of their choice equal to their natural racial hit die + the caster's INT multiplied by the spell slot level.</p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Weakening Ray</b> - Necromancy, Shadow</p>
 <p>A ray of glowing black energy beams from the caster's finger toward a creature they can see, allowing the caster to roll a normal ranged accuracy roll. If it lands, the target rolls CON resist and if they fail, they only do half damage on all attacks that use STR for the next minute.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>TRANSMUTATION - Change</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>2 - Alter Self</b> - Transmutation, Nature/Life</p>
