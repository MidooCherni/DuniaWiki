<h2><a href="../races.html">Playable Races</a> > Troll</h2>
<img src="raceimg/troll.png" class="racepic" style="width:29%">
<p>Physically imposing swamp creatures that originate from the deep jungles of southern Karra. Though they may look like more emaciated Ogres with pointy ears and noses, frog-like skin complexions and sharp piranha fangs, their true origin is unknown. They are usually 8 feet tall and extremely lanky.</p><p>
  They worship the dense and foul tropical rainforests as their “holy land” and defend them with great fury, claiming to descend from a lost prehistoric empire. 
</p>
<p><b>Slime Biology: </b>If brought down to 1 hit point while other party members survive and the killing blow was not of Fire, Shadow or Nature/Toxin type, they fall unconscious for a week while their bodies rebuild.</p>
<p><b>Regeneration: </b>Trolls regenerate 1 point per level of health per six turns in combat, or 4 per level and one of any lost limbs overnight, an amount which doubles in conditions of high moisture.</p>
  <p><b>Racials: </b>+1 STR +1 CON -2 CHA +4 Knowledge (Religion) Judge</p>
  <p><b>Health: </b>1d9 health points per level.</p>
  <p><b>Origin: </b>Trolls dwell in the deep swamps west of the Stonespine, specifically in Uk'goth, the holy land of the Trolls.</p>
