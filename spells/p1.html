 <br><p><b>1 - Bark Armor</b> - Abjuration, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster touches a target, causing a layer of the same material to grow on top of their skin over 3 rounds. This material fuses with their clothing, immobilizing them if it happens to be inflexible metal armor or the like. It absorbs 3 points of damage at a time, and lasts 1 minute provided the caster maintains concentration. The bark falls off at the end.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Protection from Good or Evil</b> - Abjuration, Holy</p>
 <p>By tracing a circle of powdered silver (or powdered iron to cast Protect from Good), the caster protects a target for 2 rounds per slot level. It causes all-evil (or good) aligned creatures which attack the target to do so at disadvantage, and fail all attempts at fear or charm).</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Protection from Vermin</b> - Abjuration, Holy OR Nature/Life</p>
 <p>By using a tiny bronze censer filled with ashes, the caster causes a chosen target they can touch to become repulsive to small insects and small rodents, which fail any attempt at biting or clawing at the target, and instinctively recoil from them. This effect lasts for 2 rounds per level.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Sanctuary</b> - Abjuration, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster touches a target, granting them spiritual protection from any attacker. If any creature were to attack the target within five rounds, it must WIS roll or be forced to switch their target. If there is no other target in sight, the initial target is invisible to the attacker.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Shield of Faith</b> - Abjuration, Holy</p>
 <p>While holding a small parchment of holy text, the caster may maintain concentration to increase the Armor of any target they can see by +2 by slot level for up to 1 minute.</p>

 <br><p><b>1 - Ice Spike</b> - Conjuration, Frost</p>

 <br><p><b>1 - Detect Undeath</b> - Divination, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster's mind immediately senses the pungence of magical undeath within 5 ft per caster level. They may also detect if the area was recently desecrated by the presence of the undead, and in what direction the offending creature went,</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>ENCHANTMENT - Mind-Addling</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Charm Humanoid</b> - Enchantment, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster causes a target within arm's reach to be magically comforted by their presence for 1 day per point of difference between their CHA and their target's WIS. Under the effect of magical charm, a target feels an inexplicable appreciation for the caster, which might lead to friendly treatment and higher likelihood of trust, aid and favorable bargain. A target that suspects they might be magically charmed will immediately snap out of it.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Command</b> - Enchantment, Holy OR Shadow</p>
 <p>Forces a creature to obey a one-word command for 1 round per caster level.</p>

 <br><p><b>1 - Healing</b> - Evocation, Holy OR Nature/Life</p>

Once they have passed, it causes the target to restore Sd8 health points where S is the miracle slot level used to cast this miracle in. Druids may add their WIS modifier to the die. This miracle has no effect on constructs or the undead.</p>
