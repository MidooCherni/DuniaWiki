<br><h2><a href="creatures.html">Bestiary</a> > Cryptids</h2>
<p>Magical beasts, colloquially known as monstrosities or cryptids, aren't constricted by the same standard of intelligence as natural animals. They are usually created by other beings for specific purposes, either magically or through genetic engineering, and are characterized by being modified animals from the material world or directly inspired by them.</p>
<p>Some of them show signs of humanoid-like sapience, and others are remarkably sage and lucid. Some of them are planar beings, originally at home in the outer planes in the world, and thus can be called using planar spells. Their home in that case is inferred from their alignment.</p><br>
