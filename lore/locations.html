<br><h2>DUNIA Lore - Locations</h2>
<img src="../img/map.png" style="width:100%; justify-content: center;">
  <h2>Northern Karra</h2>
  <p>Also colloquially known as the "man-lands" by other races and quirky humans. This area of the world faces the aptly named "sea of man" and has seen no major events be caused by any race other than humans. Scattered barbarian tribes offered the power of the Light by the elves hundreds of thousands of years ago diverged into radically different cultures with very politically strained relationships, and their empires rose and fell as other races watched.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Goldstar: </b>Common name for Asillilissu. A floating island with the last remaining major city of the Sun Elves. It's impossible to find by navigation and is protected from any kind of detection by divination. Any attempts at reaching it without the consent of the Elven council fails mysteriously. Elves are sworn to secrecy on everything surrounding their capital, It has been described as everything from heaven on earth, to a soulless collection of crystalline structures that inhabitants cross by teleportation. Myths spin tales of its enormous towers of pure gold that levitate in the sky like planets orbiting unnatural alien halls, phoenixes that circle its skies, and divine archmagi weaving shielding spells.</p>
  <p>Inspiration: </b>Silvermoon (Warcraft)</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Korak: </b>North of the man-lands, a foggy area of hills, dark forests that dip into eternal light, with its coasts full of sea monsters and constant raging storms. Duskrest is the capital of Korak, a nation of gothic shadow knights who uphold law and fight Hylonians. Its streets are dreary and seem unwelcoming, and its people are reclusive and wary of outsiders. Korakians manufacture anti-magic armor to counter Hylonian miracles. Unlike Hylonians, there is no such thing as "houses" in Korak. They operate on a council of a hundred elders from different tribes that vote democratically, and seek Witches and Druids as counsel.</p>
  <p>Inspiration: </b>Scotland, medieval Moscow, Anor Londo, Freeport (EQ 2)</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Hylonia: </b>The capital city of the Hylonian empire, which gives it its name, though the capital province is named after the ruling dynasty of Highsun. Its architecture, with its enormous churches whose ceilings scrape the sky, almost seems like it's meant to belittle the viewer. Outside of the sacred districts of the city, its lower quarters and tradeways are much more diverse and accepting. The Hylonian empire is a bustling nation that initially started as a confederation of several nations (and thus seven different houses that bicker very frequently) from the central-eastern man-lands. A high taxation rate and a social strong segregation between "holy" light wielders and the common populace keeps a tense order.</p>
  <p>Inspiration: </b>Stormwind, Holy Roman Empire, Anglo-German castles</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Wintergate: </b>A beautiful nation built in the frigid north of River Ayaat. Situated on the border of the polar region of the northern continent, this nation is famed for its world-renown craftsmen and artisans, and for its enormous gates that block Death Tundra from the rest of the world. The tribes of barbarians who live on the feral side of Wintergate maintain a tenuous alliance with humans who protect them during their travels, but are extremely quick to hostility if upset or dishonored.</p>
  <p>Inspiration: </b>Neverwinter, Qeynos, Scandinavian nations</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Cor Alia: </b>One of the 3 smaller nations of the hinterlands. Cor Alia, built over the Corian Hills, sits at the foothills of the Whitebarrier mountains right between Korak and Hylonia. Originally a haven for fleeing families of both nations escaping persecution, centuries have passed and Corians have found themselves an independent force capable of political leverage thanks to their excellent light cavalry force and fertile lands. The only thing keeping Hylonians from invading this state is the fear their guerilla tactics and merciless defensive force would weaken them enough to allow Korakians the upper hand.</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Phyrios: </b>An ex-Hylonian province standing now on the ruins of the old Isyllian empire. Loosened into independence thanks to the Hylonian focus on the northern front and financial influence from Southport. Now an intermediary trade city.</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Scipria Isle: </b>Island city standing in the middle of the Karran sea, covered in forts and fortified streets. Used as a strategic base in times of war, but in times of mild stressful peace it stands between Hylonia and Southport and is left to be slightly disheveled. As of modern times, it is crawling with beastkin who are too much of a hassle to remove.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Corian Province, Hinterlands: </b>The foothills that trace the eastern half of the Whitebarrier mountains from Korak down to the Crystal Lake. Grassy and only mildly hilly. The territory is known for its vast stretches of fertile prairies well-suited for agriculture and farming. Unmarried laborers in the Corian hinterlands tend to live nomadic lives of moving from farm to farm looking for work and traveling to Cor Alia to spend their gains.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Crystal Lake: </b>One of the basins of River Ayaat, largely limits the region of the Corian Hinterlands from its south. Beautiful, crawling with marine life, with pine forests sloping around its waters. Known for its rare mythical lake beasts and fishing towns.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Karran Sea (Martyred Sea): </b>The sea that separates Hylonia from Southport. Bordered by the old Isyllian Empire's ruins, now the city of Phyrios to its west, and the Dagger Strait which opens into the Ocean of Man. Wonderful beaches. Many harbors.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Lios Region, Forest: </b>The major forest in Hylonia's territory. Despite the industrial expansionism of the Hylonians, their superstition makes them recoil from extremely feral places. Mythical animals such as owlbears, treants and unicorns are known to dwell in the area. There are few druids, as they have been purged centuries ago, meaning the wildlife in Lios Forest occasionally goes crazy and has to be subdued. Witches are attempting to move in.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Lush Peninsula Region: </b>The part of Hylonia's territory that stretches into the ocean. Many castles which are abandoned during times of tenuous peace. Old military towns still stand along the fortified roads to coastal ports that allow Hylonia access to the ocean.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Nightwood Region: </b>The major forest in Korak's territory. Inhabited by several allied circles of Druids who aid the Korakians by way of Divination and other kinds of augury. Extremely foggy, easy to get lost in if one doesn't know how to travel, to the point it's reputed that the deeper parts of the wood are covered by a canopy that simulates eternal night. A variety of terrifying creatures like shadow wolves prowl, making them even more dangerous than Lios, yet the presence of strong archdruids keeps nature balanced within.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Plains of Strife: </b>The stretch of land between Korak and Hylonia. Some of it is scarred by trenches, reinforced roads and ruins of fortifications, but some of it has regrown already. It's difficult to find a settlement in the Plains of Strife, as most people consider it to be a vast, empty transitional area from one kingdom to another. Enterprising adventurers have found a variety of underground dungeons of unknown and ancient origin, and dare the wrath of both kingdoms to plumb them for riches.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - River Ayaat: </b>A beautiful river which flows down from the northernmost peaks of Whitebarrier mountain, flowing down to feed the cities of Wintergate and Korak before draining in the north sea, into the Karran sea and into the crystal lake. Wide enough to be very populated with trade and travel boats all the time; as the north of Korak gets colder, travelers find it more convenient to take a ship up and down the Ayaat.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Sea of Man: </b>The great body of water between the polar continent and the Dagger Strait to the Karran Sea. An incredible history of violent naval warfare, attempts at expansion and misery. Largely devoid of islands, unlike other seas. Goldstar is reputed to float somewhere in here, though it's nigh impossible to find it.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Vurden Foothills Region: </b>The forested and rocky stretch of land north of the ruins of Isyllia or Phyrios. Not as inhabited as the northern side of Crystal Lake, but there are many military outposts along fortified roads. Good way to travel south if avoiding the sea. The landscape is hilly and strewn with boulders, and the only guarded areas are the roads that lead to the mineshafts still in use by the Hylonian capital. Straying to the side exposes one to the risk of having to deal with wild animals and bandits.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Whitebarrier Mountains: </b>An enormous stretch of mountain peaks that cuts the northern hemisphere into East and West Karra. So sharply high and violently inhospitable that it's impossible to cross normally. The few gorges and valleys within are guarded ferociously by the dwarves of Iklistzefon, who act as protectors of the lands west of the barrier. Inhabited by wild animals, constantly snow-capped and utterly hostile to the unprepared. While half a dozen different toll towns exist, the gates of Iklistzefon proper face Crystal Lake.</p>
  <p>While crossing the Whitebarrier is theoretically possible with enough preparation, the hostile freezing weather and impassable rugged terrain is one of the reasons civilization has largely remained insular to either sides of the mountain chain. In freezing weather, creatures do not regenerate health while resting, unless protected from the cold by magic or in the safety of a cave lit by a fire. At the start of every hour not wearing heat-insulating padding or magical protection against Frost, non-Undead creatures must roll CON or suffer frostbite, which causes a stacking -1 to DEX and AGI penalty as well as half their racial hit die in damage. The DC is 10 at the low foothills, 15 at the mountainside proper and 20 at the peaks. When heated, DEX and AGI return gradually over one hour Carriages and other land vehicles cannot cross the rugged terrain of the Whitebarrier unless by magical levitation or by crossing guarded Dwarven highways. At the highest peaks, the cold is so bitter that flight is impossible.</p>
  <h2>Southern Karra</h2>
  <p>A violent, hostile land considered barely habitable by most races. Unlike the fertile lands of the north, the south of Karra is a land of scorching, vast desert, sun-blasted death valleys, barren savannahs and rotten jungles. Enterprising adventurers base themselves in Southport, which is the closest the continent gets to a relatively safe haven. Few caravans are known to cross along the shade of the Stonespine Mountains, with any wandering off course having to struggle for their life from the murderous heat and wild creatures.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Angilrom: </b>Home of the notorious Red Dwarves, named "Kunrid" by their kin Unlike the White Dwarves, these creatures have kept the ancestral veneration of the Dragons that their ancestors followed, and bask in the glory of war and fury.</p>
  <p>Angilrom Dwarves paint their faces and bodies with woad and earthen dyes, and sport odd hairstyles. They are as violent and unfriendly as the lands they inhabit, demanding everyone they meet prove themselves in the field of battle or on the forge. Their homes are built in the rocky badlands north of the Stonespine on the border with the desert.</p>
  <p>Despite their temper, they are capable of incredible displays of craftsmanship, and so their creations are prized as legendary artifacts- by those who can get their hands on them.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Gorran: </b>A relatively small cooperative nation of humans and half-orcs who live on the eastern coast of the desert facing the South Seas. They fight the insectoid demons of Khanfusaj and occasionally raid caravans for resources. Rumor has it that the ethnic descendants of the Isyllian empire fled and relocated here after the fall of their empire millennia ago.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Khanfusaj: </b>Reputed to not even exist anymore. From patches of recovered historical records and information reluctantly given by Gorranians, an extensive underground city built over a complex cave system several hundred miles long is apparently said to extend under the Eshran desert. It is inhabited by giant demonic insectoid creatures bent into the shapes of centaur-like arachnid, wasp-like and scorpion creatures. Its architecture is reminiscent of Abyssal temples. Either that, or gates to the Abyss permeate the underground of the Eshran.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Southport: </b>Commonly named for its capital port city, the nation that runs along the coast is called Junubia. Initially a federation founded by a group of retired pirate lords, Southport experienced a population boom after the Hylonian unification drove out dissenters. Ever since that age, the city has styled itself as a haven for anyone fleeing persecution.</p>
  <p>Southport proper is a crowded, chaotic trading metropolis built along the coast of the Karran Sea. Its streets crawl with exotic stores lined up with every imaginable good known to man, with its winding alleyways crossing high warehouses and residential towers and open markets that seem to be built with no clear planning. The center of the inner city hosts expensive restaurants in which affluent members of the high class enjoy extravagant meals, pungent liquors and music played by renowned bards. For more down to earth members of society, the harbors are lined with countless bars, casinos and ramshackle inns.</p>
  <p>Inspiration: </b>Amn, Baldur's Gate, Gadgetzan</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Redrock: </b>Scattered Ogre tribes that inhabit the south gather in what could be reluctantly called a "city" on the southernmost peninsula of the continent. Seen from above, Redrock could be mistaken for an incoherent forest of boulders and animal skins, but once inside it becomes clear the Ogres have an affinity for stone carving, and tend to establish their dwellings inside giant hollowed out boulders.</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Uk'goth: </b>The tropical rainforest that stretches along the western coast of the Stonespine is known as the Holy Land of the Trolls. Millenia ago, when the mortality of the Dwarves and Elves was recent, a powerful empire spanned the entire western peninsula of Southern Karra which was separated from the desert east by the Stonespine mountains. The Trolls, originally a race from the Shadow Plane, escaped the grip of their fate, taught themselves independently how to wield the light, and proceeded to wage a crusade on the insectoid Khanfusaj which were beginning to build a large empire east of Stonespine.</p>
  <p>Myth has it that the Trolls sacrificed greatly to banish the Khanfus underground, at the cost of being blasted back to the stone age and losing their powers. Though mostly ruins now, the Trolls still protect the remains of their empire zealously, and refuse to ally themselves with any other race no matter the cost, though some Trolls begrudgingly turn to mercenary life.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Blight Swamps: </b>The outskirts surrounding the rainforest cities of Uk'goth and its temples consist of rotten swamps, which ooze fetid and toxic winds all days of the year. Swamp air is nocive to all non-native races of the area bar the Trolls, and make exploration extremely dangerous. Rumor has it that a variety of temples harkening back to the golden age of the Trolls are buried by the swamps yet still dry on the inside, with the riches and historical relics that fill their halls being still intact. However, even if any delvers miraculously survive the hostile conditions of the swamp, they risk tempting the wrath of the protective Trolls.</p>
  <p>While in the swamp, no creature can see beyond 30 feet without truesight. Every hour and once at the start of a combat encounter, creatures must roll Knowledge (Nature):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1-2: </b>Fall into a sinkhole. Drop to 0 AGI. Roll STR DC 15 to pull; three failures kill.</li>
    <li>3-8: </b>Bitten by a mosquito. Take 1d4 Nature/Toxin damage.</li>
    <li>9-12: </b>Notice a nearby methane vent. Any Fire spell going off nearby damages all creatures.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><p><b>Region - Canyons of Woe: </b>As the foothills of the north give way to an ever-shrinking land bridge, one will find their entryway into the southern continent to be through the maze-like barren land known as the Canyons of Woe. Infested with crag-nesting harpies and other hostile wildlife, one might wonder whether the eventual settlements of Angilrom they might encounter would be a respite or an even worse sight. A few human settlements from Southport dot the region, though travelers are not entirely safe until they reach the city proper beyond the canyons, which are prophetically shaped like a long series of hallways.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Eshran Desert: </b>The most infamous feature of the continent by far; a massive dune desert that stretches all the way from the southern reaches of the nation of Janubiya to the red and rocky badlands of Redrock. Bordered to the west by the steep Stonespine Mountains and in the east by the Gorranian nations and the South Seas, it is mostly a vast stretch of empty nothing where barely any creature can survive.</p>
  <p>Travel across the Eshran without knowing the intricate network of secret oases known to the natives by astrological orientation is guaranteed suicide. All creatures need to drink water equal to their racial hit die in liters per day, or suffer disadvantage on every single roll. Every hour spent under the sun reduces STR, CON, DEX and AGI by 1 point each incrementally. If a creature's CON modifier reaches -1 as a result of this, they suffer a heat stroke and go unconscious. Finding shade resets this timer over a period of 1 hour.</p>
  <p>Wiser travelers and the civilized stick to the ledge of the Stonespine as they cross southward for any reason. Titanic burrowing monsters, insectoid demons, furious elementals and djinni as well as bandits of every shape and size await the unwary, as well as the promise of hidden treasure and ruins of times when Abyssals still roamed the world.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Merchant's Isle: </b>A small pair of islands off the eastern coast of Southport. Known for its exotic fruit and dangerous pirate fortresses yet to be plumbed.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - South Seas: </b>The aquatic stretch that faces South Karra from the east. Contrasting the Sea of Man which faces Korak and Hylonia, the South Seas stretch from the Dagger Strait which leads into the Karran Sea and down to the bottom of the world. These waters are still completely infested with pirates, who are still very much active and surround the Thousand Isles region. Trade with the nation of Ryon is absolutely bustling, which invites enterprising adventurers and vultures alike to adventure.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Southern Mudhills: </b>Colloquial name for the stretch of badlands that surrounds the Ogre nations. A dreadful biome of uneven mesas and quicksand that offers a twisted respite compared to the murderous scorching emptiness of the desert. Also known as the "dreadlands", for they were once the home of an infamous Gorranian sorcerer-king.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Stonespine Mountains: </b>The mountain-peaks that stretch from the Canyons of Woe all the way down to the Mudhills, protecting the western half of the continent from the Eshran desert. The incredibly steep mountains, which are very difficult to cross, keep the winds from crossing to either side, leaving one half of the continent humid and swampy, and other dry and sandy. The mountains are known to be home for multitudes of leonine beastmen called the Leijon, who hunt in packs and enjoy pulling tricks on unsuspecting travelers.</p>
  <p>While walking the Stonespine mountains beyond the foothills, characters may have to roll d20 to face hostile winds that change every 4 hours on average and d8 for its direction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1-2: </b>Unusually calm.</li>
    <li>3-9: </b>Mild leaf-swaying winds. Movement is halved for every creature. Flying creatures and objects receive double speed instead if flying in the wind's direction.</li>
    <li>10-14: </b>Violent howling winds. In addition to the latter, every land creature must roll CON against DC 10 or fall down for one round.</li>
    <li>15-18: </b>Violent tree-bending winds. In addition to the latter, stability roll becomes DC 15. Failure blows away creatures 40 - CON feet in the wind's direction.</li>
    <li>19: </b>Flash windstorm. In addition to the latter, ranged attacks and flight become impossible for creatures smaller than Dragons. Stability roll becomes DC 20. Creatures must succeed in the roll to move against the direction of the wind.</li>
    <li>20: </b>Catastrophic hurricane. Flight becomes altogether impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><p><b>Region - Wailing Savanna: </b>In a triangular formation right between the mountains and the Canyons of Woe, a stretch of barren yellowed grassland dotted with the occasional canopy trees separates these areas from the sandy dunes. The steppes are home to many creatures; elephants, giraffes, monkeys, lions, zebras, and even tribes of beastmen such as Leijon, Loxodon and Centaurs, who live minimalistic lives as hunter-gatherers. Though the latter are capable of speech, they are extremely wary of outsiders, as everyone is in the south.</p>
  <p>A complicated chain of alliances and bitter feuds exist between the clans and even the races themselves; the Centaurs are locked in eternal war with the Minotaurs, the Leijon and Loxodon maintain a tenuous alliance in order to discourage the Gorranians and Orcs from splitting their forces and attempting to move up north. Nobody is at peace with the Dwarves.</p>
  <h2>Western Karra</h2>
  <p>A mystical and legendary land that lies past the Whitebarrier mountains. This continent was the site of most legendary stories that unfolded during the Empyrean Age. Unlike the relatively safe north and the merciless south, the west is a land of unpredictability, magical biomes, artificial terraforming and exotic creatures, weathers and settings that defy mortal logic. There are very few, if any, roads safe for mortal passage, as all the races that call the lands beyond the barrier their home simply know it ancestrally. Despite this, there are a few places a human or beastkin could call safe refuge, and even a forgotten faction of man lost within.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Iklistzefon: </b>The fabled city of the White Dwarves. Originally the capital of all of dwarvenkind after the fall of the Dragons, it is where their ancestors the Magma Giants retreated for thousands of years to hide from the other gods.</p>
  <p>Iklistzefon has gone through several rebuilding projects that modernized it across the ages, but has remained as mesmerizing and breathtakingly imposing as ever. Enormous statues of dwarven heroes lift the high ceilings of the hollowed out mountain-cities, with rings and bridges dividing them into districts whose roads are broad enough to allow caravan passage. Imposing gates secure the great highway that allows passage across the Whitebarrier.</p>
  <p>Some of the greatest forges and the deepest mineral mines in the world are situated here, leading all the way down magma seas, barely a few hours of travel away from one another by mount. The peaks of Whitebarrier surrounding Iklistzefon also house lesser dwarven cities, accessible by well-guarded tunnels. Iklistzefon is ruled by King Urist Stonebeard XVI, who will pass his name on to his heir.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Miraldia: </b>Although human activity is mostly confined to the man-lands, the west has recorded one more strain of this race which has, long ago, departed from their homeland to settle this mystical realm. Miraldian humans were nomads thousands of years ago who founded cities near the running rivers far to the west of Summerfall Glade.</p>
  <p>In a time before their recorded history, some catastrophe struck which led them to pray to the nearby Elves for succor, who taught the latter protective druidic spells to protect their tribes. The humans of Miraldia initially took up druidism, in the way of the elves, until internal clashing brought them back to stone-castle sword and armor feudalism. Despite this, the royal capital of Miraldia continues to be protected by a ring of human druid-advisors, who safeguard it using their barrier spells and blessed miracles. Their home capital is a breathtaking landscape of circular towers with swirling vegetation, massive green arch gates and manmade waterfalls.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Nunorroszne: </b>Or Nightholme. Beneath the untamed dense forests of the Wildlands, it is reputed that the Ash Elves who managed to flee the Draconic continent after their downfall began civilization anew. A series of hollowed out cavern cities miles beneath the earth are home to all kinds of mythical creatures, as well as a few Elven cities.</p>
  <p>The Drow that dwell within are furiously xenophobic, aggressive and uncooperative, and build their cities around the worship of vengeful dark gods of shadow, so it may be for the better that they remain there.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Ondius: </b>Built on the Crimson Weaver's Peninsula and isolated from the rest of the world by Miraldian magicks, this forgotten joint kingdom of humans and Drow was once a thriving nation like all others. Their fall occurred when they signed a pact with some planar deity to grant them the powers of vampirism, which did not go as well as predicted.</p>
  <p>The streets of Ondius are charred and derelict, with winds howling through vastly empty yards that were once parks and markets. It remains sparsely populated, mostly by the living dead, centered around the aforementioned Crimson Weaver's mansion.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Tel'layl: </b>Deep in the heart of the Feywood jungle, a series of tree-cities and underground burrows form the great nation of the woodland Elves. Marked by its intricate druidic stone circles, cascading waterfalls, Satyrian music and rows of rangers observing from the canopy, Tel'layl is unmistakable. A glistening pool of raw liquid magic surrounds the greatest tree in the center, which is easily a few miles in girth, and opens naturally to allow the Elves and druids to make their homes within. The only semblance of technology here are the Gnomes, who are more open to dealing with outsiders than wild Elves or childish Satyrs.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Xiom: </b>Pronounced "shee-um." One of the more modern cities in the realm of Dunia, Xiom is a technological marvel built in the north right before the beginning of Death Tundra. Nestled in a snowy valley between two great peaks, and cleverly hidden from detection by a sphere of floating psychic mirrors, one can still observe the colorful neon lights and billowing steam rising from its factories. The nation is a coalitionary effort between Cog Priests and Engineers from all walks of life that have kick-started a golden age of innovation.</p>
  <p>The streets of Xiom are asphalt-paved, crossed by smog-puffing industrial vehicles, and everywhere one goes, they are surrounded by rickety steel-plated buildings, factories, hive-like housing complexes, as well as a staggering number of gambling houses and arcades. Flying zeppelins take travelers across the quarters of its capital. Despite all the good brought about by technology, Xiom is also a nation of great inequality, much like Southport, as those born into this realm who don't find a knack for industry or invention instead slip into its slums and the less savory aspects of the Xiomish way of life.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Death Tundra: </b>The vast spread of land north of the western continent is a sludgy hell that sits lower than the freezing temperature of water most of the year. Receiving little to no rainfall, the ground consists of barren wastelands of permafrost dirt covered in colorful lichen. The only thing that breaks up the dreary red and brown stretch of emptiness is the piles of mossy rocks and the sight of mountains in the distance. Limited to the south by the coniferous forests of the Upper Wildlands and Mistvale Pass, and to the north by the sea, it is reputed that many a Necromancer has their lair within, though attempting to find them while chased by yetis, sabertooth lions and mammoths is an equally suicidal task to plumbing them.</p>
  <p>Much like the Whitebarrier, all points of the Death Tundra cause hourly frostbite at a 15 CON DC. In freezing weather, creatures do not regenerate health while resting, unless protected from the cold by magic or in the safety of a cave lit by a fire. At the start of every hour not wearing heat-insulating padding or magical protection against Frost, non-Undead creatures must roll CON or suffer frostbite, which causes a stacking -1 to DEX and AGI penalty as well as half their racial hit die in damage. When heated, DEX and AGI return gradually over one hour. Depending on the time of the year, the day-night cycle can be twisted to 24 hours of sunlight in the midsummer month or 24 hours of total dark night all winter.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Feywood: </b>The southern coast of the continent is home to an ecosystem of temperate jungles so thick, so hostile to external life and so impassable, some dare say it's even more efficient at killing than the Eshran desert itself. The spirits of the Feywood that dwell within are capricious and uncaring, and if it weren't for the woodland Elves and the Satyrs' open efforts, the land would be a death trap for any mortal.</p>
  <p>The Feywood is largely untouched by the outside world's progress. All cabins are swallowed by the earth, non-magical fires awaken the wrath of treants and dire wolves, and the river waters that flow from the great tree of Tel'layl down waterfalls and cascading to the sea are jealously guarded by water spirits and powerful elementals. Travel through, in and out of the Feywood, which signals its borders by its unnaturally twisted circular trees, is practically impossible without the guidance of a Fey Elf, Satyr or a woodland Gnome, or the blessing of a powerful Druid of 15th level or higher.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Great Summer Steppe: </b>South of the Wildlands and north of the Hills of Anarak, the vast expanse of land not covered by the temperate jungle of the Feywood consists of an enormous flat steppe. Miles and miles of featureless yellow-green grazelands gives off the illusion of a boundless calm ocean of chlorophyll, occasionally broken up by herds of bison and wild horses. This is one of the least densely populated areas of the world that is still reasonably capable of bearing life. Its soft dirt and lack of timber or bodies of water makes any kind of permanent settlement very difficult.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Green Coast: </b>The name of the humid stretch of coast from Tel'layl down to the Scarred Wetlands. The coast is sandy, as it faces the relatively tropical weather of the far south of the western continent. It is home to several nameless human settlements that harvest exotic fruit and spices and work textiles from rare mystical silks. Enterprising traders and pirates from myriad nations are aware of the importance of this place, and whether through force or negotiation maintain routes to and from here.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Hills of Anarak: </b>Just south of the Great Summer Steppe, the vast expanse of flat grassland begins to give way to more varied elevation and thicker forests. This relatively much more populated region of the western continent is dotted with a few human settlements, mostly in the rivers that cut valleys through the steep hillsides. Named after some forgotten religious icon of the pre-unification tribes of men that dwelt in the region, the Anarak is a verdant landscape of deciduous forests and fertile glades. The massive amount of leaves dropped by the seasonal trees means very fertile soil that easily holds many farms.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Mistvale Pass: </b>Right between the Reothian Glades and the Upper Wildlands is a steep and foggy region which could be said to mark the beginning of the coniferous forests that stretch along the rest of the continent. Known for being the ancestral homeland of Half-foots and Gnomes, his place almost mirrors the Feywood in its unassailable beauty, and the fog that creeps up and down the forested cliffs of the pass constitutes a danger to travelers.</p>
  <p>Every 4 hours, travelers in this area must roll a d6. On an odd number, the area is blanketed in fog that makes it impossible to see anything beyond 30 feet. If the roll lands on 1, every creature in the area is under the effect of a mist spell that covers the whole zone. Half-foot settlements are immune to this effect.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Reothian Glade: </b>An elevated plateau off the western side of the Whitebarrier which marks the end of surface-ground Dwarven outposts. The terrain is rocky and vegetation is sparse besides shrubs and ferns which grow reluctantly on the limestone floor. This land offers a momentary respite and a sense of normalcy before the Mistvale Pass signals the beginning of the exotic lands of the west.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Scarred Woods: </b>Right below the Hills of Anarak, the biome slowly changes from seasonal deciduous forests to thick, broad-leaved evergreen forests that cover steep hills. Within this labyrinth of vegetation is said to be Miraldia, the legendary capital of the Druidic humans, who have no need for a harbor or dedicated farmland due to their connection to the wilds. Glades in the form of long stretches of land covered in stone circles give the land its name, and seem from an eagle's eye view like scars or claw marks that cut the canopy.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Sea of Shadows: </b>The great ocean south of the western continent. It is a relatively tropical area of the world in which the few little islands regularly see violent monsoon winds. This stretch of water is known for its violent sea monsters, and is said to have been in ages past a gate to the aquatic plane beyond the stars. Whether out of superstition or because of the countless horror stories of crews being swallowed by incomprehensible abyssal monsters, all pirates and traders in the area tend to only trace the Green Coast, and are extremely timid about drifting away from visible land. Tales speak of lost cities beneath the violent waves.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Stormcall Highlands: </b>South of the Reothian Glades, a relatively quaint weather-wise plateau of land rises in the skies. Historically said to have been the home of a now extinct race of avian humanoids, it is held extremely sacred by Stormlords who will often visit it on pilgrimage. The shamans who maintain the delicate stone circles and monuments within this arid shrubland mesa tend to recognize them, but staunchly turn away others. Besides natives, this area is inhabited by goats, harpies, giant eagles that nest on cliff sides and antelopes.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Upper Wildlands: </b>Right between the Death Tundra and the warmer Summer Steppe is the subarctic region of the world. A continuous boreal forest stretches from coast to mountains, occasionally broken up by giant lakes inhabited by mammoths and sabertooth cats. The temperature in the thick pine forests of the Upper Wildlands taiga is below freezing most of the year, but even though the snow melts in the summer and spring, the soil is too poor to maintain any kind of farms, and what could be considered game is very hostile and dangerous.</p>
  <h2>Drae'nin</h2>
  <p>A huge mass of land in the middle of the ocean, on the other side of the planet from the Karran continent. Historically, this used to be a beautiful island-continent on which every biome could be found, and was inhabited by the noble yet ambitious proto-elves. When they sought to dominate their brothers by summoning and enslaving the Dragons into servitude, their plan backfired, and the entire landmass exploded into violent hellish cataclysm, cursing it to forever be a reflection of Dunia's ancient Draconic age. Though the true dragons were repelled, their mindless legions of dragon-headed humanoids that numbered in the hundreds of thousands were too numerous to dispose of.</p>
  <p>Perhaps miraculously, the Dragonkin began to feel a mental disconnect from their creators, and instead of becoming mindless death drones, they turned to worshiping them instead. They soon turned inward, building a city of their own amidst the apocalyptic wastes that remained. One of the most famous features of Drae'nin is the giant industrial train system that cuts the continent from north to south, from the heart of the Dragon Kingdom to Ur'ken and down to the trade settlements in the lower cape of the Southern Barrens.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - The Dragon Kingdom: </b>The world's greatest and only warrior-city. Built right over the charred remains of an ancient elven nation, the Dragonkin have reclaimed the valleys for themselves and sought to build their own home country in the ways of the other races. The mountainous area of Drae'nin features an elaborate network of canyons and caves and slopes which, at night time, appear studded like the starry night sky by an innumerable amount of fires and motes of torchlight that signal the presence of Dragonkin civilization.</p>
  <p>Despite having no real need for them, the Dragonkin erect countless homes, barracks and temples fashioned of timber, dragonbone and leather from the skin of native animals. Temples looked after by wily Dragon shamans are as abundant as the gladiatorial arenas and fight pits in which they test their mettle for sport. Smitheries, markets and a surprising number of libraries are built along the winding stony streets.</p>
  <p>The Dragons have no need for a ruler of their own kin. Despite having achieved sentience, there lingers in their minds a fanatical devotion to the Dragon God. The capital of Draconic civilization is built around the slopes of a singular mountain peak that juts from the earth, the top of which is carved in the form of a great hall that leads to an unpowered portal to the Plane of Hate. Prophecies state that one day, the Dragon God will return to rule the world from his rightful place at the yet vacant throne room at the highest point in Drae'nin.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Ashen Hills: </b>The outskirts of the Dragon Kingdom features a seemingly endless stretch of grayed pastoral chaparral. Rivers and thus fauna and trees are rare and only sporadically dot the enormous hilly area. Gigantic ungulate creatures, reminiscent of dinosaurs, roam the area and are frequently hunted for sport by the Dragonkin.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Bloodrun Sound: </b>North of the Dragon Kingdom, on the northern coast of the continent of Drae'nin, a network of straits and islands separate the Dracon Ocean from the great Bloodrun Bay. Harbors belonging to the Dragon Kingdom line the shore, populated by countless junk-style Draconic boats. As the Dragonkin have been all but stripped of conquering ambition, the main use of their navy is for trade with Southport, to actively capture and torture pirates, and to wage mock battles amongst themselves.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Mount Ur'ken: </b>Sitting close enough to the Dragon Kingdom to be visible from the horizon, the famed volcano of Ur'ken rises menacingly, surrounded by the Scorchlands. It was harnessed by the Dragonkin hundreds of years ago, who managed to subdue the flow of magma and pool it harmlessly beneath the crust of the volcano, then built an array of workshops and lesser cities within its inner rim.</p>
  <p>The region could be considered the industrial heart of the Dragon Kingdom, as only in the oppressive heat of the Draconic blast furnaces, and only at the hand of their centaurean Draktaur can their legendary armor be forged. Their equipment rivals that of the Dwarves in its power and longevity, though its designs are much more crude and haphazard and chaotic by comparison. Materials are regularly shipped in and out of the titanic Draconic foundries through the Drae'nin train system.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Scorchlands: </b>The dry and inhospitable land surrounding Mount Ur'ken is known as the Scorchlands. Its geography consists of arid volcanic stone hills occasionally dotted by obelisks of eroded black stone. Lakes of molten magma occasionally pour over into rivers and bubble ominously. The region is largely incapable of sustaining life, with a permanent cloud of ash darkening the sky, although bits of red lichen and tough fern manage to eke out a rough existence. The few Dragonkin who take up traditions that are frowned upon in their culture, such as Necromancy or the study of Vampirism, usually self-exile here. Consequently, this area is known for its hidden death barrows and evil temples. Train tracks that serve the Drae'nin train system cut through this place mercilessly.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Southern Barrens: </b>Far south of the kingdom and from volcanic ash clouds, a rocky stone desert covers the southern span of the continent. More traditional creatures roam these areas, such as antelopes, coyotes, cougars and countless species of snakes and birds of prey. The animals in this area very rarely linger around train tracks, as the dreadful roaring horns of the industrial trains of Ur'ken send them into incomprehensible terror. To the south, in the bay of the continent, a few shore cities manned by the Dragonkin are open to trade with the Thousand Isles and other nations of the South Seas.</p>
  <p>Being a desert, this area follows the same rules as the Eshran. All creatures need to drink water equal to their racial hit die in liters per day, or suffer disadvantage on every single roll. Every hour spent under the sun reduces STR, CON, DEX and AGI by 1 point each incrementally. If a creature's CON modifier reaches -1 as a result of this, they suffer a heat stroke and go unconscious. Finding shade resets this timer over a period of 1 hour.</p>
  <h2>Thalij</h2>
  <p>North of every other continent, a mysterious landmass shrouded in arctic fog rends the north seas. It is deemed too dangerous by most races for even shallow exploration. With its violent frigid winds, its utterly hostile fauna and its demon-infested valleys, the continent of Thalij is considered outright uninhabitable by some; though a few notable settlements exist.</p>
  <p>Being intolerably cold, the entire continent is subject to the same weather rules as Whitebarrier Mountain and Death Tundra. All points of Thalij save for cities cause hourly frostbite. In freezing weather, creatures do not regenerate health while resting, unless protected from the cold by magic or in the safety of a cave lit by a fire. At the start of every hour not wearing heat-insulating padding or magical protection against Frost, non-Undead creatures must roll 15 DC CON or suffer frostbite, which causes a stacking -1 to DEX and AGI penalty as well as half their racial hit die in damage. When heated, DEX and AGI return gradually over one hour. Depending on the time of the year, the day-night cycle can be twisted to 24 hours of sunlight in the month or 24 hours of total dark night all winter.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Alin: </b>Above the arctic skies of the frozen continent, a conglomeration of the most powerful human wizards in the history of Dunia have decided to join forces to build an apolitical haven for themselves. Several kilometers of arcane-woven crystalline skyscrapers cover a flying chunk of ground that levitates effortlessly above the snow-white landscape. Its streets are forbidden to all but the most practiced and well-known of magi and their apprentices and entourage. It is the dream of every practicing wizard to one day peruse the Kingdom of Alin's vast libraries and see its gem-encrusted pillars lift its decorated ceilings into the sky- although the council of mages that rule it are aggressively exclusionary with whom they invite.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Ingizishol: </b>Known as "the roof of the world" in Dwarven, this city was once a minuscule trade post built by the Iklistzefon dwarves. After a few campaigns to drive back the forces of chaos during which they reluctantly allied with the wizards of Alin, their outpost ballooned into a nation of its own right with several underground divisions, a fully functional military force, their own industry and navy and their own cultural identity. Several generations have passed on, with the original founders of Ingizishol being long dead, their descendants evolved to have much paler skin and hair than other Dwarves. For those without a bent for the arcane, this might be the only place resembling a safe haven whatsoever on the continent.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Chillspine Mountains: </b>Perhaps named ironically after the Stonespine in the south, this relatively smaller range of mountain peaks cuts Thalij in half. To the south, the lush taiga of Prismaborea and the White Fjord face the rest of the world. To the north, the barren arctic desert of the Lichlands signals the end of nature and the beginning of artificial unlife.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Coldscar Wastes: </b>Within the valleys of the Chillspine, a certain stretch of land is known for being the site of an ancient wizard war that nearly tore the continent in half. The plateau now referred to as Coldscar is characterized by gigantic cuts of ground, as if dug by the claws of a planet-sized being. Within these scars, unnatural arcane beings and demonic portals flow and bubble futilely into existence. Depending on how the wind flows in the area, the flow of magic is altered. Every 4 hours, all magic users must roll a d6. On an odd number, all magic costs 1 higher tier than original to cast. On an even number, all magic is cast as if it was 1 spell tier stronger. On a 1, magic ceases to function entirely.</p>
  <p>Despite the danger inherent to such an unstable place, it is dotted with an innumerable amount of abandoned wizards' towers and strongholds, many of which still hold powerful artifacts from the time they were used in war, as well as the guardians that once protected them.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Lichlands: </b>The wizard war that segregated the population of Alin led to the barren north being overrun by different clans of Necromancers across the centuries. Beyond just hostile weather, this area of the world is closed off by the wizards and is a banishment pit for dark mages and abyssals of all kinds. The very earth itself pulsates with tumor-like growths that blacken its surface, and the few wooded areas that remain have turned sickly and diseased. Black spikes protrude from the ground signaling the territories of Necromancers who jealously loom from the tops of their dark towers, each ruling an area of the Lichlands, largely trapped within by their own rancorous envy of one another as much as they are by the mystical barriers erected by the wizards of Alin. Holy magic does not function within the Lichlands.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - North Seas: </b>The frigid waters surrounding the arctic continent are seldom traversed by explorers or even pirates. Besides the absolutely freezing weather, constant fog and rimy winds, the waters are infested with some of the worst sea life second only to the Shadow Sea of the West. Many glaciers jut out of the water in natural barriers that could easily spell the end for any sailor not skilled enough to weave their vessel around the forest of icebergs.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Prismaborea: </b>Contrasting the murderous cold of the rest of the continent, the taiga hills surrounding White Fjord to the southwest of Thalij are relatively quaint. Still, they are inhabited by the typical wildlife of northern regions; territorial yetis, hungry sabertooth tigers and polar bears, as well as murderous mammoths await those foolish enough to rest on their laurels. The Dwarves of Ingizishol run a largely stable number of lumber mills in the area that supply them with their needs in resources, though fending off the occasional creatures that crawl out of the nearby Coldscar Wastes is an unenviable and regular task.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - White Fjord: </b>To the southwest of the continent, the arctic waters carve in a deep and narrow inlet surrounded by the wilderness of Prismaborea. Known as White Fjord, this place was the site of several failed attempts at colonizing Thalij. Now haunted by the spirits of countless deceased sailors and explorers driven mad by the influence of the Lichlands.</p>
  <h2>Thousand Isles</h2>
  <p>Extending from the southernmost cape of Karra to Drae'nin, a chain of mountainous archipelagos dot the bottom of the South Seas and crawl with all manners of life, from thalassocratic civilizations to native islanders. This area is a hot spot for sailors, pirates, explorers and anyone seeking treasure, fame and fortune through the deep blue. Its history is a history of naval warfare, trade and piracy.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Ryon: </b>The current local ruling power in the Thousand Isles. Once a minuscule, powerless community of mountain-dwellers from the largest isle of the central archipelago. They were oppressed for centuries by the Apekin who used them as slaves, before the arrival of the Dragonkin and the consequent conflict between them and the apes allowed them the opportunity to rise up. The great golden age of Ryonese humans resulted in revolutions in art, poetry, warfare and sciences. Perhaps exotically compared to other humans, the Ryonese worship the water goddess of fortune and luck as their primary deity.</p>
  <p>The city of Ryon itself is a bustling metropolis that stretches from its harbors to its mountainous hinterlands, with rocky roads twisting and winding up its hills and around its innumerable red gates, lantern-lit pagodas, temples and markets. On paper, it is ruled by a dynasty of emperor-priests said to be able to speak to the goddess herself at will, though in practice, many warlords hold sway in different provinces of the island outside the gates of its city, only ever recognizing the emperors when on temporary visit to pray or trade.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Amber Mountains: </b>Deep inland, far from the safety of the cities of Ryon, the extremely steep maze of heavily forested mountains is usually avoided by travelers. The Amber Mountains cut the great capital island in half, with the civilized side protected by rainforests, and the other side being a dry and arid steppe plateau. This area is home to both pious hermetic monks and ruthless bandit lords alike, both reveling in the isolation it allows. A network of temples, ancient fortresses and castles extend as deep into the ground as they rise into the sky. Four of the thirteen clans of Ryon have their bases here.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Jade Forests: </b>The relatively temperate rainforest on the civilized side of the Amber Mountains is home to varieties of exotic wildlife not even dreamt of by the western races. Its thick, lush hills are home to all sorts of mythical trickster spirits that toy with outsiders at best and outright prey on them in many cases. The beautiful lakes of the region are maintained by fortune clerics who pray to the goddess. Six of the thirteen clans of Ryon have their bases here, with stone forts erected in glades deep in the oppressive forest.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Ruby Steppe: </b>On the other side of the Amber Mountains from the capital city of Ryon, a vast high-altitude plateau stretches all the way to the sea, which is sparsely inhabited and mostly populated by shrubs and ungulates. Hidden in the valleys between the hills of the Ruby Steppe, usually near one of the rivers of the area, three of the thirteen clans of Ryon have their bases here. Domestication of wild horses is extremely popular, as crossing the steppe on foot is largely unreasonable for anyone but the most dedicated pilgrims.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Great Southern Archipelago: </b>Though smaller than the capital island of the thalassocratic empire of Ryon, an innumerable amount of islands and atolls dot the seas. The islands range from lush tropical rainforests contained only by the waters that surround them to massive volcano islands sparsely inhabited by natives, and everything in between. Though the Ryonese navy watches over these islands jealously, the sheer number of adventurers, traders and pirates trying to plunder island forts, find treasure, bag sea monsters and make contact with natives is too large for any centralized power to stop.</p>
  <h2>The Outer Planes</h2>
  <p>        As seen in the History section, the world of Dunia consists of two primordial powers, a sea of light and a sea of shadow, constantly crashing and bubbling in the threshold that separates them. The plane that sits between these two forces bubbles and foams like the crashing waves of the sea, and within persistent bubbles made immortal by the powers of one or more beings within them ascending into immortality, we find inhabited worlds.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Astral Sea: </b>The thin sheet of chaos that separates the two primordial forces of the cosmos is easily the width of the entire known universe to mortal creatures. It consists of an infinite expanse of colorful nebulae dotted with stars that bundle together like spiderwebs, peppered by dead worlds and the occasional titanic drifting corpses of failed gods. Its borders up and down with the primordial seas are completely invisible from a distance, up until they are actually reached by the observing being. Once close enough, the bright radiance of the Sea of Light and the tar-like vantablack shadow of the Abyss become visible.</p>
  <p>The Astral Sea separates the planes and is used by most creatures as an intermediary crossed to reach another destination. Despite its unstable nature, some powerful divine creatures have taken an interest in this place and many sought to claim their own territory within it. Unnaturally bent Astral monsters of myriad origins, mysterious star-dwelling humanoids, as well as gangs referred to as "void pirates" occasionally populate the space between worlds.</p>
  <p>While in the Astral Plane, creatures do not age or feel hunger, thirst or fatigue. Gravity here is also subjective. A creature in control of their own movement can choose where to float.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Ethereal Plane: </b>Superimposed over the material world of Dunia, an invisible, foggy space of translucent ghostly gray houses souls that are not yet ready to pass on. When a soul dies in Dunia, a vortex in the sky begins to pull at them, attempting to send them to one of the afterlives, if any. If the being's will to stay is powerful enough due to unfinished business or a strong grudge, they might resist the tug of the void and linger on to haunt the living. Beings who haven't quite "died correctly" such as the undead, or those who have their souls split by magic, fail to pass on regardless of how much they want to.</p>
  <p>Certain spells allow a being to make contact with the Ethereal Plane, either observing it or crossing through it to become intangible in the mortal realm. Its associated element is Time.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Sea of Light: </b>An incomprehensibly infinite ocean of pure dazzling golden light. It stretches up to no end, and has no solid ground. It lacks gravity much like the Astral Sea, and thus creatures can float in any direction.</p>
  <p>The Sea of Light is bright and searingly hot, threatening to permanently blind any creature not protected from fire or magic of the outer planes. It is so bright that it's impossible to see anything without specific blessing from the native creatures, though a darkness spell can offer momentary shade. Within this realm, non-magical textiles burn, non-magical metal melts, and any unprotected liquid evaporates immediately. Within this realm of light, the cells of mortal creatures swell with unnatural radiance and reproduce uncontrollably, causing -1 CON per turn and eventual internal explosion. Planar Chaotic Evil creatures below the 10th level are annihilated immediately, and higher level ones suffer disadvantage on everything until they leave.</p>
  <p>The lower reaches of the Sea contain numerous floating cities and fortresses which house native celestials. The higher a being ascends up the Sea of Light, the more esoteric and incomprehensible the beings they encounter become, until the very sight of one of the true elementals of radiance is enough to immediately psychically kill the viewer.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Sunken Abyss: </b>A fathomless sea of black demonic antimatter sludge sitting at the bottom of the world. Much like the other celestial seas, it has no solid ground or gravity, and thus creatures can float in any direction.</p>
  <p>        The Sunken Abyss is a semi-solid realm of oppressive and choking darkness. Creatures that survive the dissolving entropy notice that moving around feels like trudging one's whole body through a thick liquid. No light save for the magical kind can illuminate this realm of inky blackness. Within the Abyss, all non-demonic creatures slowly begin to decompose at a rate of 1 racial hit die per round. No Holy magic of any kind functions here, and planar Lawful Good creatures below the 10th level are annihilated immediately, while higher level ones suffer disadvantage on everything until they leave.</p>
  <p>        The realm where Demons are born screaming and flailing out of the primordial shadow ooze is tainted with a kind of incomprehensible evil that predates the invention of morality. Its only purpose is to eat away at existence and annihilate it until entropy has rendered everything into a void of cold emptiness. The further down one goes, the more likely they are to feel the effects of the midnight calliope spell, having to resist the urge to give in to the screeching babble and the sight of innumerable teeth and eyes and distorted beings bent into horrifyingly unnatural shapes chasing them. Even Demons recoil from this foul place, as all beings that think and feel are enemies of the powers of entropy, even those birthed from it. Consequently, most Demonic cities are built on the surface of this black slime, with a few exceptions.</p>
  <p>        Despite its nature, or perhaps as a reflection of this, it is reputed that the dark fathoms of the abyss are ruled by star-sized entities beyond mortal comprehension.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Lunatic Kingdom: </b>Built on the surface of Dunia's moon an uncountable amount of millenia ago, its origin is shrouded in mystery. Some say the first Lunarians were proto-elves who were so deeply disgruntled by the degeneracy of their kin that they levitated away to settle on the moon and try to regain divinity. Others say Lunarians are pure elemental spirits that simply coalesced out of the Sea of Light for the express purpose of watching and guiding the development of sapient beings. Regardless, the large metropolis known as the Moon Capital is inhabited by eternal spirits known as Lunarians who consider it their sacred duty to watch over the mortal world and guide the deceased through the afterlife.</p>
  <p>Ruled by the Moon Princess Amar, the Lunatic Kingdom and the Lunarians represent one of the nine planar realms that orbit the mortal world of Dunia, though it sits somewhere outside the traditional alignment system. They are dedicated to maintaining the neutral balance of the world, openly opposing the overreach of both Demons and Celestials, and asserting that the lives of mortals are their own to lead as they please until they die. It is said that the Lunatic Kingdom is the origin of the magnetic power that tugs at the ghosts of the deceased, and that the dead stand trial on the moon before Lunarian saints decide the best afterlife to send them to.</p>
  <p>Perhaps surprisingly to many, the Lunatic Kingdom is fairly technologically advanced. The embassies and tribunals and offices in which logistical paperwork and accountant labor is performed to track the life and death of every sapient being, as long as the dress code of specialized Lunarian accountants are alienatingly modern.</p>
  <p>A monastic order of militant fighters from all races of the world known as the Sailors of the Sky is dedicated to protecting the kingdom and ensuring no extraplanar being or ambitious mortal interferes with the natural process of death and celestial transition.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Beasts and Jungles: </b>The Elysian realm of Sylphja, the mother of all beasts and flora, seems like an echo of Dunia that is severely overgrown, with much more dramatic natural features. Also known as Ysgard, or Arborea. Largely sharing the same set of continents, forests and jungles as the material world, but extending explosively into vast tangles of gigantic trees that rise into the sky like towers, and mountain peaks that seem to scrape the very skies. The landscape here is much brighter, with vivid colors and shades unseen in the natural world and flora that twists into myriad complex geometric shapes and swirls.</p>
  <p>Outsiders visiting this place besides Satyr, Elves and Lunarians are so overwhelmed with its alien beauty that they must roll WIS at DC 15 every hour or lose it idly mesmerized, unless guided away. All animals and flora on the plane are sentient and intelligent, capable of holding conversation, and can cast magical spells as if they were Druids of equal level. Animals on this plane are gathered in clans and kingdoms lorded over by animal kings and priests much like with mortal civilizations. The powerful Chimerae are the upper class of animal society, whereas the Unicorns and the great dragon Ykhdar act as protectors and sages to all Good creatures.</p>
  <p>The realm attracts Chaotic Good souls, who are reborn in Valhalla, lose the ability to starve, tire or feel boredom, and are allowed to hunt the immortal fauna for sport, harvest eternal fields, build homes of their own and fight for fun. The realm's associated element is Life.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Dreams and Mischief: </b>Also known as the Dark Carnival or Limbo, this realm ruled by the twin Messiahs of Mischief is a fever-dream-like landscape of haze and nonsense. Giant colorful tents, pillars of neon light and spinning wheels and shapes extend in every direction, while random objects lost to miscast spells tend to find their way here. The planet itself is divided into two regions, with one receiving constant comfortable daylight and the other being a realm of perpetual maddening night where beings of pure terror dwell. Whether an outsider is the victim of harmless jocular mischief by anthropomorphic funny animals or hunted down eternally by mirthful Nightmare-riding laughsassins that feed on the emotion of terror depends on which side of the plane they're on.</p>
  <p>The coherence of geography and physical features of the plane is largely subject to the willpower of the beings that observe it. Creatures with less than 10 WIS have absolutely no conscious control, with higher scores allowing an increased ability to concentrate on "shaping" the realm to the observer's desires, being able to cause spell-like effects of increasing strength. Every emotion is amplified tenfold and reflected in the viewer's surroundings; despondency or fear saps away color and invites vampiric death clowns to feed on negative emotion, while courage, anger or joy cause an explosion of prismatic mania that paints the world vivid.</p>
  <p>The realm attracts Chaotic Neutral souls, who are reborn on either of the sides based on how well they fare in a series of carnival games. The realm's associated element is Heart.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Fire and Loathing: </b>Also known as Hell or Gehennom, this realm ruled by the Archdevil King Ashmedai is an endless landscape of boiling magma and black obsidian castles erected over hills of brimstone. An impenetrable, omnipresent canopy of swirling red clouds threatens to rain pure fire and feed the great lakes of lava that roll over the landscape. Showers of meteors and explosive fire cover the surface of the world at irregular intervals, and just existing in it twists minds to match its vile nature. Packs of violent Hellhounds occasionally stalk the surface of this plane and act as jailors and torturers.</p>
  <p>This place is the realm of fiery Hellementals, but chiefly Devils- mischievous spirits that represent hatred, spite and grudge, and delight in manipulating each other and outsiders. The highest calling in a devil's life is the specific process of goading others into destroying their own lives through subversion and psychology. Thus, they occasionally travel out of Hell in the unstable guise of mortals to find beings power-hungry or naive enough to bargain with them. Devil society puts a great focus on the act of manipulation itself over the outcome, and so a devil will never derive joy in or respect any method used to get the upper hand on another that isn't psychologically complex and insidious. Devils hide their true intent when dealing with mortals in double-entendre, incomprehensible jargon, technicalities, fine print and unintuitive conditions, and are more than prepared to lawyer a mortal who thinks they can outwit them- though in the rare occasion the mortal succeeds, devils are compelled by an uncontrollably powerful instinct to honor their word no matter the consequences.</p>
  <p>Every day, a random area is blanketed by the effects of the spell reckoning, and every hour explosive gas causes the spell fireball to erupt somewhere at random. Furthermore, creatures that aren't explicitly evil must roll WIS against DC 10 + 1 for each day already spent in Hell, or feel tempted to commit an act of malice as if under the effect of magical suggestion.</p>
  <p>The realm attracts Lawful Evil souls, who are dragged screaming into the forms of worthless maggots to be whipped by devils until they are cleansed of sin, or resist so long they begin to transform into devils themselves. The realm's associated element is Wrath.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Frost and Limbo: </b>Also known as Hades, this bitter ice world is described as an eternal prison where color and all positive emotion are dulled. It is divided into the frozen surface and the endless labyrinthine cavern underground. Its surface is a frozen hellscape of supernatural winter, with howling winds that send almost all mortal creatures not protected by mystical shields flying like particles of dust. The wind is often strong enough to rip chunks of earth from the very faces of mountains, and the only beings that can withstand it are the Jotun, also known as the giants, and their magical gryphon pets.</p>
  <p>Jotun society is divided into a caste of six different levels that depend on the giant's ancestry and is fervently respected by all. Mud and Red giants live in caves and warrens dug out to accommodate their enormous villages. As it takes them tremendous effort to maintain their footing, they rarely wander out except for errands or travel, and live out their lives plumbing the underground to provide other giants with raw materials. They are manic, spiteful, bitter and jealous, with Mud giants being so out of sincere idiotic hatred and the cleverer Red giants being more motivated by greed and malice. They make up 60% of the total Jotun population.</p>
  <p>Rock and Frost giants erect cities that run along the windy surface of the planet, usually nestled between valleys, with the former serving as reclusive artisans and builders and the latter being feral warriors that wage endless war and raid one anothers' settlements. They are more detached than their lesser kin, though equally as prone to violently lashing out over nothing. They make up 30% of the total Jotun population.</p>
  <p>Cloud and Storm giants live in castles that orbit the sky of the plane, being utterly titanic in size and dwarfing even other giants. Perhaps because of their distance from it, they are detached, aloof, wise and kind. Their function is to lord over their brethren, halting their occasional attempts at genociding their own race, and providing shamanic foresight. They make up less than 10% of the total Jotun population.</p>
  <p>The underground of the world consists of a planetary network of caves in which countless evil souls are tortured, ripped, stretched, distorted and collected by the ghastly shades and spectral wraiths native to the plane. Elemental beastkin made of gems and crystals dwell here, gathered in monastic orders around the underground. They hunt the souls of the damned for sport and practice all styles of combat All across the plane, the air is known to randomly erupt into wormholes that connect areas to one another, and often to other planes, in patterns only known to the most sage of the native species.</p>
  <p>While on the plane, no spell, miracle or feat described as harnessing a positive emotion to bolster a creature functions. Every hour or so, the DM rolls a d20 and chooses a random location for a portal to spawn. If the score is 1, the portal links the surface to the underground and vice versa. If the score is 20, the portal is extraplanar and links to a random plane. Furthermore, Conjuration spells are 2 slots cheaper here, to a minimum of 1.</p>
  <p>This realm attracts Neutral Evil souls, who are cast into the bowels of the underworld to be tortured by spectral undead and gemkin until they pass. Its associated element is Boundary.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Law and Clockwork: </b>Also known as Nirvana, this is the realm of absolute precision, impossible mathematical perfection, automation and utter equality. Unlike other planes, this realm consists of several spinning rings of solid earth encircling a set of linked gears floating in space. The inner part of the earth rings, facing the gears, exert gravity going outward, hence creatures falling off the edge of the thousand kilometer wide halos fall outside into space. The core of the plane, which is the set of gears, have their own special gravity with a clear "up" side and "down" side. The plane is in a perpetual state of night, illuminated as if by a full moon by the lights of the gear core.</p>
  <p>The rings of sand are covered with vast, barren dunes of sand, only occasionally broken up by settlements of sphinxes and djinni that gather together in temple-cities. The sphinxes that dwell in this plane are more than intelligent, and thoroughly enjoy puzzle solving, mind games, quandaries, mulling over paradoxes and posing difficult questions. Several monuments, pyramids and oases are located in equal distance from one another. All the trees are rearranged in mathematical sequences, and the leaves and stalks curl in neat geometric patterns. It is said that the shape proportionality of natural phenomena in the material world is nothing compared to the razor precision of the flora that grows on the rings.</p>
  <p>The eponymous core of gears consist of several spinning plates of clockwork, each a thousand miles wide, linked together by bridges, over which sprawls an enormous machine city. The entire nation is home to automatons that divide themselves into different aspects of labor, service, government and bureaucracy. They are eternally self-maintaining, and some of them could be said to be sentient. The top-most gear houses the great divine tribunal, a council of 12 godlike and perfect machines that have attained divinity, who are omniscient to everything going on in the universe, and know the identities of all mortals.</p>
  <p>        No kind of Illusion magic functions on this plane, and attempts at casting it while on the floating clockwork city will quickly turn its inhabitants hostile.</p>
  <p>The realm attracts Lawful Neutral souls, who are reborn in the bodies of the automatons on clockwork city. Depending on their performance while on the plane, they may be promoted and attain even more power than they had in their mortal life. They are protected by sphinxes, who act as their guardian angels. The realm's associated element is Mind.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Light and Faith: </b>Known by mortals by many names, mostly after the large sprawling heaven-cities that span its surface. The Kingdom of Heaven, Arcadia, Shangri-la, Celestia or Tian. Its core is a small earthly planet covered in beautiful fields of wheat, dotted with mountains and flying monasteries and temples in the clouds in which pious souls guarded by powerful angels retire into peaceful eternal lives of meditation and worship.</p>
  <p>An enormous mountain known as Olympus rises from the core planet, piercing the skies and acting as the pathway to the upper heavens. The planet is encircled by seven layers of solid clouds on top of which increasingly more esoteric and beautiful cities are built. The further up one goes, the closer they reach the Sea of Light, although any creatures in this plane save for Chaotic and Evil creatures are protected from its negative effects. The Heavens have no particular god or guardian, but are tended by angels that sacrifice their boundless existences in the Sea of Light to shepherd good souls into this world. They are led by the Archangels, the most powerful of which is known as Saint Ein the First, a Seraphim of strong divine might who organized the banishment of the Dragon God countless eons ago. Pegasi, native to this realm, fly up and down the world protecting it from outsiders. They occasionally wander onto the material plane, in search of true heroes worthy enough to serve unquestioningly.</p>
  <p>No kind of Shadow magic or Necromancy will function in this realm, and attempting to conjure any creature alien to this place will fail, instead spawning a will-o-wisp containing the soul of the creature that would have been conjured. At the base, spells cast by Evil creatures cost 2 slots higher. In the first Heaven, this applies to Chaotic creatures as well. In the second heaven, this applies to Neutral creatures as well. In the third and on, all the named creature types are completely silenced. The second-to-last layer of heaven silences all creatures by Lawful Good creatures. The last layer of Heaven hurts all non-Lawful Good creatures in the same way being in the Sea of Light would.</p>
  <p>This realm attracts Lawful Good souls, who are reborn at the age of sexual maturity for their species wearing indestructible silken gowns that protect them from all attacks, halos that protect them from all harmful magic, and wings that allow them to fly at will. The realm's associated element is Light.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Oceans and Rain: </b>A great ocean planet consisting of a small core of black trench rock covered by several kilometers of water. This realm is home to the healing goddess Lirrea, the mother of all aquatic life and harbinger of good rains and winds.</p>
  <p>Its surface is dotted by several island nations resembling tropical archipelagos. The waters are always calm, and winds form by the sheer will of those on it, in order to guide vessels and aid them in finding shorelines. It is a heaven for sailors and farmers and the innocent. Swarms of bright clouds circle the plane in regular intervals, showering the islands with magical healing rains that heal all creatures caught within, purge any negative effect or emotion, and allow any kind of life to flourish to supernatural levels. The ocean proper is teeming with all forms of aquatic life imaginable, animalistic, sentient and more. All points of the ocean are full of marine animals, living tritons, mermaids, sirens, naiads, krakens, naga and water elementals that organize themselves into underwater cities built around coral reefs. They all exist in harmony with the spirits of the dead who dwell on the islands and allow them to fish at their leisure under the care of the water goddess. The water of the plane itself has healing properties, closing wounds and accelerating regeneration when any organic thing is doused in it.</p>
  <p>The cities at the bottom of the ocean, however, are independent of the goodly nature of the rest of the plane. Native creatures are wary of outsiders at best and outright xenophobic at worst. Empires of marids, tritons and other sea dwellers who worship the eternal sea monster Golybidon stretch deep beneath the crushing pressure of the abyssal seas. They begrudgingly protect souls on this plane, but have no reservation about annihilating aliens to this world who are lured by the safety of the surface. The sacred hippocampi that live in the ocean allow any being the ability to breathe water as if it was air, and to swim with great aptitude.</p>
  <p>This realm attracts Neutral Good souls, who are reborn on the islands to live their lives peacefully, soothed by the eternally regenerating waves of any negative emotion and allowed to sail, fish and travel as they please. The realm's associated element is Fortune.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - The Plane of Rot and Shadow: </b>Of all the realms in the Astral Sea, this is by far the most openly malevolent, vile and vicious of all. An endless hellscape that takes the form of several metaphysical flat planes stacked one on top of the other, with chasms and openings in the ground allowing one to fall downward, but never up.</p>
  <p>The different layers of the plane vary in shape depending on the demon ruling them at any specific time, which is subject to change. However, the thing they have in common is the theme of utter desolation. Black deserts with crimson skies that rain blood, gangrenous pulsing hills and sharp spiky trees that move as if they were living, vast oceans of pus and bile… This foul domain is the home of the demon race that move there after being spawned from the Abyss and are immediately whipped into servitude by other larger demons.</p>
  <p>The demonic race is about as varied as the animal kingdom on the material plane. These creatures are more like representations of the angst, hatred, phobias and bitterness of the mortal races made manifest in physical form, their shapes inspired by uncanny and unnatural creatures seen in the nightmares of mortals. Insectoid demons the size of horses skitter on many legs. Shaggy gorillas twisted into gigantism drool as if rabid, with disgusting bat-like wings tearing out of their backs and unnatural claws growing the size of knives. Decomposing humanoids, some stringy with spiked bodies and some of titanic size with gnashing maws and eyes growing all over their bodies, swing about enormous whips and swords inflamed with black fire, seeking to capture other lesser demons or aliens to torture for the sheer thrill.</p>
  <p>Demons are characterized above everything by their pure and impractical sadism. The meaning of life, to a demon, is nothing more than to exert as much pain, as thoroughly and slowly as possible, whether through malice or violence. Unlike their cousins the devils, demons have no respect for systems or words, and simply follow a raw bestial instinct to inflict suffering. Despite some of them being highly intelligent, they make for horrible strategists due to their caprice, narcissism and impatience. The closest thing demonic society comes to having a hierarchy is the fact larger and more powerful demons will enslave lesser demons simply for the pleasure of making the lives of their subordinates an inescapable prison of fear and tyranny. Therefore, while demons prefer existing in a state of unimpeded impulse and gluttony, fear of stronger beings is the only way anything ever gets done when dealing with a demon.</p>
  <p>This realm is a sink for all creatures deemed Chaotic Evil, that are sent to be tortured for sport by the demons. There is no way for a mortal to attain any kind of position in this hellscape, but demons can grow in size and strength. In this plane, damaging spells and illusions cast by Chaotic or Evil beings are cast 2 tiers stronger. The realm's associated element is Rot.</p>
