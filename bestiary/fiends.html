<br><h2><a href="creatures.html">Bestiary</a> > Fiends</h2>
<p>The collective name for all native beings of the lower planes: Devils, Aberrations and Demons. Each of them is characterized by their alignment (LE, NE and CE, some CN.)</p>
  <p>Devils are wicked spirits of spite and grudge that delight in manipulating mortals for sport. Aberrations come from the dark corners of the Abyss and are incomprehensible to all. Demons are collectively characterized by their violence, impulsiveness, sadism, ego, hatred and cowardice, and by their complete inability to feel love or compassion.</p>
  <p>Demons are immune to Shadow and Nature/Toxin spells, while Devils are immune to Fire. All of them take double damage from Holy spells whether stated or not.</p><br>
