<h2>Dunia TTRPG Rulebook</h2>
<h2>IMPORTANT: The bestiary, item list and advanced mecahnics section is still STILL INCOMPLETE. I migrated the entire thing from a Google Drive to HTML in ONE ALL NIGHTER and I feel like I'm gonna FUCKING PUKE. Feel free to peruse the rest at your leisure using the bar on the left until I wake up and send feedback!</h2>
<p>Dunia plays like D&D, with some modifications that make it faster and more varied. You and a party of your friends start with a shared quest, and the campaign lasts until the mission is over. Throughout the game, a narrator will crunch numbers and play the NPCs.</p>
<p>This game is first and foremost an elaborate stage play; it's important to leave the arcade video game mentality at the door when playing Dunia. The point isn't to "win" or soullessly "accumulate" points, or to "be done with it". It's chance to become an alternate universe version of you who studies arcane magicks in a fantastical world of elves and dragons, who heads out to the wilderness hunting for rare reagents or new spells, or a version of you who wields an axe or bow and lives in the mountains surrounded by animals, or who escaped the army to become a treasure hunter, or a you who makes a living slinking in the underbelly of the city dagger in hand...</p>
<p>Roleplay is about becoming an actor, and bringing the character you're assigned to life. Maybe you're out to make a name for yourself, as thousands before you have, by uncovering a well sought after artifact. Maybe you're out to solve a conspiracy in the name of your favored faction. Maybe you're just power-hungry and after riches for the love of the hunt.</p>
<p>How many great stories in history were about a party of allies synergizing their talents to fulfill a great quest- The warriors Odysseus, Menelaus, Ajax, Achilles and Agamemnon in the Iliad, Jason and the Argonauts, Wu Kong and the monk Tang Sanzang, the 108 companions in Water Margin, the fellowship of the ring... When playing tabletop roleplay, think less of meta-gamed parties with healers, tanks and strats, and more of history.</p>
