  <p>Also known as Evoker or Elementalist. A scientist who specializes in pure magical energy, and seeks to perfect the art of transferring, storing, transforming and directing it as if it were a magnetized fluid.</p>
  <p>Wizards are by far the most versatile magic user. They are not content in simply using magic as a tool for personal aims, but rather consider the mechanics of energy conversion and the myriad of its uses, from forming projectiles and barriers to calculating ways to warp the position and physical properties of creatures and objects, to be an art form worthy of dedicated study for its own sake.</p>
  <p>The professions available to a Wizard are as broad as their field of study. Some are employed as dedicated warmages in service of royal armies, or as court scientists who can aptly catalog and identify magical artifacts and phenomena for the benefit of their employer. Some others rejoin the academic environment from whence they were trained to become teachers and headmasters. The more powerful Wizards tend to seclude themselves in towers of their own creation that serve as home, personal library and museum all in one, as the mental and physical toll of delving into the arcane for most of one's lifetime tends to leave exceptionally traveled Wizards aloof and disinterested in mundane social activity. In some cases, the stress of toying so close to the divine without attaining it has been known to create Shadow Wizards as evil, destructive and self-obsessed as the worst Necromancer, but also Theurgists as selfless and altruistic as monastic healing Clerics of the light.</p>
  <p><b>Level 1: </b>Wizards may choose a certain Specialization to focus their research on. This allows them to change their nomenclature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Pyromancer: </em>Can cast any Fire spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper.</li>
    <li><em>Cryomancer: </em>Can cast any Frost spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper.</li>
    <li><em>Aeromancer: </em>Can cast any Nature/Air spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper.</li>
    <li><em>Geomancer: </em>Can cast any Nature/Earth spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper.</li>
    <li><em>Venomancer: </em>Can cast any Nature/Toxin spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper.</li>
    <li><em>Aquamancer: </em>Can cast any Nature/Water spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper.</li>
    <li><em>Graviturge</em> or <em>Spatial Mage: </em>Can innately cast <i>Telekinesis</i>, <i>Feather</i> and <i>Enlarge/Shrink</i> as if they were 2 spell slots cheaper, <i>Warp Space</i>, <i>Magnetism</i>, <i>Reverse Gravity</i> and <i>Event Horizon</i> 1 spell slot cheaper, and <i>Fly</i> without consuming a spell slot.</li>
    <li><em>Theurgist</em> or <em>Chronomancer: </em>Can innately cast <i>Haste</i>, <i>Slow</i> and <i>Time Stop</i> 1 spell slot cheaper, as well as rewind time: </em>consuming a spell slot to dispel magic, two to cast Healing at an slot level, or all spell slots currently available to cast Resurrection. Furthermore, casting slow on an enemy who's casting a spell delays it by 1 more round.</li>
    <li><em>Shadow Wizard: </em>Can cast any Shadow spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper, speak Abyssal, and step through the Plane of Shadow when casting the Invisibility spell.</li>
    <li><em>Illusionist</em> or <em>Enchanter: </em>Can use CHA instead of INT as a spellcasting attribute, cast any Enchantment or Illusion spell as if it was 1 spell slot cheaper and maintain multiple illusions at once (1 per 4 levels.) They may also cast minor illusion without slot.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Level 4: </b>Wizards may choose to <em>bounce</em> a projectile or beam spell, halving the damage to cause the spell to also affect another nearby target within casting range of the first.</p>
  <p><b>Level 8: </b>Wizards gain <em>advantage</em> on Knowledge (Magic) and Use Magic Device.</p>
  <p><b>Level 12: </b>The Wizards' spell bounce is upgraded to <em>chain spell</em>, halving damage and offering a maximum of 4 targets.</p>
  <p><b>Level 16: </b>Wizards may empower a spellcast that includes any dice roll to deal its <em>maximum value</em> once per day per 5 levels.</p><br>
