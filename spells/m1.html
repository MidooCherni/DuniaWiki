<h2><a href="mlist.html">Mage Spells</a> > Tier 1</h2>
<p> <b><center>ABJURATION - Protection</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Alarm*</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster enchants an instrument of any sort to loudly sound off if a creature the size of a rat or larger comes within 20 ft of it. The enchantment lasts 2 hours per caster level.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Mage Armor</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster manifests a barrier of magnetic force around the target that absorbs 2 points of damage at a time up to a total of 8 points.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Protection from Evil</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>   By tracing a circle of powdered silver (or powdered iron to cast Protect from Good), the caster protects a target for 2 rounds per slot level. It causes all-evil (or good) aligned creatures which attack the target to do so at disadvantage, and fail all attempts at fear or charm).</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Protection from Vermin</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>By using a tiny bronze censer filled with ashes, the caster causes a chosen target they can touch to become repulsive to small insects and small rodents, which fail any attempt at biting or clawing at the target, and instinctively recoil from them. This effect lasts for 2 rounds per level.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Shield</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster manifests a barrier of magnetic force that causes all ranged attacks made against the target to suffer a -4 accuracy penalty.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>CONJURATION - Transportation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Conjure Component</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Summons up to two common, cheap, naturally occurring spell ingredients of choice.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Conjure Duplicate</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a teaspoon of silver, the caster holds an object aloft in one hand and summons the nearest reasonably identical thing to it. It only works if the resulting object is free to be moved by a creature with a STR score equal to the caster's primary spellcasting attribute. The summoned object's original location leaves a lingering field of magic that can be detected.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Conjure Mirror</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Causes a flat plane of space in front of the caster to reflect all rays and gaze spells for 2 rounds + 1 per caster level. This mirror follows the caster around and can be oriented.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Find Familiar*</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Once per year, a caster may attempt a ritual to call a familiar. A familiar is an immortal magical entity that takes the shape of a critter familiar (hence the term) to the caster and appropriate to the climate the ritual is performed in. A familiar can communicate telepathically and in any of the languages known to its master. It can hold an intelligent conversation, fetch small things and serve as a scout or messenger.</p>
 <p>Familiars are limited by their physical form. They cannot deal damage in combat, but are endowed with 10 health points per spell slot that, if depleted, force them to phase out until the ritual is cast again. Familiars also gain the general instincts of the critters they embody- cats and ferrets are easily distracted by vermin for example. Though familiars enter service fervently loyal to their master, they remember mistreatment, neglect and unreasonable demands. Gods and divine beings are fond of familiars and are more willing than usual to avenge them.</p>
 <p>The summoning ritual for a familiar consists of lighting 1,000 gold coins worth of herbs and incense in a bronze brazier and maintaining focus for twelve hours.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Grease</b> - Conjuration, Nature/Earth</p>
 <p>Causes a 10 ftÂ² surface area to be covered in magical grease for 3 rounds + 1 per slot level. All creatures on it must roll AGI every round or risk falling prone.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Mist</b> - Conjuration, Nature/Water</p>
 <p>Surrounds a 2^n meter area (where n is the slot level used to cast this spell) in thick fog that obscures vision of other targets for one minute per level of the caster.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>DIVINATION - Unnatural Sight</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Comprehend Language*</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a pinch of soot and a pinch of salt while touching the creature or material, this spell causes the caster to understand one language of their choice for one hour. They gain the ability to speak, read and write it as if they had 1 skill point in it.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Detect Magic*</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster's mind thrums with energy resonating along with the presence of any sort of magic within 5 ft per caster level.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Identify*</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a pearl steeped in wine, the spell allows a caster to answer one simple question about an object's identity, origin or use per slot level.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Measure</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>Allows the caster to sense the exact distance between two points visible to them.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>ENCHANTMENT - Mind-Addling</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Charm Humanoid</b> - Enchantment, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster causes a target within arm's reach to be magically comforted by their presence for 1 day per point of difference between their CHA and their target's WIS. Under the effect of magical charm, a target feels an inexplicable appreciation for the caster, which might lead to friendly treatment and higher likelihood of trust, aid and favorable bargain. A target that suspects they might be magically charmed will immediately snap out of it.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Command</b> - Enchantment, Arcane</p>
 <p>Forces a creature to obey a one-word command for 1 round/spell slot level.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Sleep</b> - Enchantment, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a small pinch of sand, the caster causes a number of enemies equal to their level to fall asleep for as long as the caster focuses on this spell, up to one minute per caster level, or until awoken. Targets may roll CON to resist if they're busy or in combat.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>EVOCATION - Energy Generation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Flame Spray</b> - Evocation, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster swings their arm in a wide horizontal arc in melee, causing a splash of liquid flame that deals 1d8 Fire damage + 1d8 for each slot level above the 1st used to cast this spell in.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Magic Missile</b> - Evocation, Arcane</p>
 <p>Sends a bolt of pure magic (and one more at caster levels 3, 5, 7 and 9 for a maximum of five) to strike a visible creature at the speed of a flying arrow. Each missile deals 1d4 damage.</p>
 <br><p><b>1 - Thunderclap</b> - Evocation, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>The caster claps their hands together, causing a terrible strike of thunder to erupt from their body and deal 1d6 damage, +1d6 for each slot level used to cast this spell in above 1st, to every target in a 15 foot radius. If victims fail a CON save, they are pushed away. If they succeed, they only take half damage.</p>
