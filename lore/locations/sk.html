<h2><a href="../locations.html">Locations</a> > Southern Continent</h2>
<center><img src="sk1.jpg" style="width:90%"></center><br>
<p>A violent, hostile land considered barely habitable by most races. Unlike the fertile lands of the north, the south of Karra is a land of scorching, vast desert, sun-blasted death valleys, barren savannahs and rotten jungles. Enterprising adventurers base themselves in Southport, which is the closest the continent gets to a relatively safe haven. Few caravans are known to cross along the shade of the Stonespine Mountains, with any wandering off course having to struggle for their life from the murderous heat and wild creatures.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Angilrom: </b>Home of the notorious Red Dwarves, named "Kunrid" by their kin Unlike the White Dwarves, these creatures have kept the ancestral veneration of the Dragons that their ancestors followed, and bask in the glory of war and fury.</p>
  <p>Angilrom Dwarves paint their faces and bodies with woad and earthen dyes, and sport odd hairstyles. They are as violent and unfriendly as the lands they inhabit, demanding everyone they meet prove themselves in the field of battle or on the forge. Their homes are built in the rocky badlands north of the Stonespine on the border with the desert.</p>
  <p>Despite their temper, they are capable of incredible displays of craftsmanship, and so their creations are prized as legendary artifacts- by those who can get their hands on them.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Gorran: </b>A relatively small cooperative nation of humans and half-orcs who live on the eastern coast of the desert facing the South Seas. They fight the insectoid demons of Khanfusaj and occasionally raid caravans for resources. Rumor has it that the ethnic descendants of the Isyllian empire fled and relocated here after the fall of their empire millennia ago.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Khanfusaj: </b>Reputed to not even exist anymore. From patches of recovered historical records and information reluctantly given by Gorranians, an extensive underground city built over a complex cave system several hundred miles long is apparently said to extend under the Eshran desert. It is inhabited by giant demonic insectoid creatures bent into the shapes of centaur-like arachnid, wasp-like and scorpion creatures. Its architecture is reminiscent of Abyssal temples. Either that, or gates to the Abyss permeate the underground of the Eshran.</p>
  <br><p><b>Nation - Southport: </b>Commonly named for its capital port city, the nation that runs along the coast is called Junubia. Initially a federation founded by a group of retired pirate lords, Southport experienced a population boom after the Hylonian unification drove out dissenters. Ever since that age, the city has styled itself as a haven for anyone fleeing persecution.</p>
  <p>Southport proper is a crowded, chaotic trading metropolis built along the coast of the Karran Sea. Its streets crawl with exotic stores lined up with every imaginable good known to man, with its winding alleyways crossing high warehouses and residential towers and open markets that seem to be built with no clear planning. The center of the inner city hosts expensive restaurants in which affluent members of the high class enjoy extravagant meals, pungent liquors and music played by renowned bards. For more down to earth members of society, the harbors are lined with countless bars, casinos and ramshackle inns.</p>
  <p>Inspiration: </b>Amn, Baldur's Gate, Gadgetzan</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Redrock: </b>Scattered Ogre tribes that inhabit the south gather in what could be reluctantly called a "city" on the southernmost peninsula of the continent. Seen from above, Redrock could be mistaken for an incoherent forest of boulders and animal skins, but once inside it becomes clear the Ogres have an affinity for stone carving, and tend to establish their dwellings inside giant hollowed out boulders.</p>
  <br><p><b>City-State - Uk'goth: </b>The tropical rainforest that stretches along the western coast of the Stonespine is known as the Holy Land of the Trolls. Millenia ago, when the mortality of the Dwarves and Elves was recent, a powerful empire spanned the entire western peninsula of Southern Karra which was separated from the desert east by the Stonespine mountains. The Trolls, originally a race from the Shadow Plane, escaped the grip of their fate, taught themselves independently how to wield the light, and proceeded to wage a crusade on the insectoid Khanfusaj which were beginning to build a large empire east of Stonespine.</p>
  <p>Myth has it that the Trolls sacrificed greatly to banish the Khanfus underground, at the cost of being blasted back to the stone age and losing their powers. Though mostly ruins now, the Trolls still protect the remains of their empire zealously, and refuse to ally themselves with any other race no matter the cost, though some Trolls begrudgingly turn to mercenary life.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Blight Swamps: </b>The outskirts surrounding the rainforest cities of Uk'goth and its temples consist of rotten swamps, which ooze fetid and toxic winds all days of the year. Swamp air is nocive to all non-native races of the area bar the Trolls, and make exploration extremely dangerous. Rumor has it that a variety of temples harkening back to the golden age of the Trolls are buried by the swamps yet still dry on the inside, with the riches and historical relics that fill their halls being still intact. However, even if any delvers miraculously survive the hostile conditions of the swamp, they risk tempting the wrath of the protective Trolls.</p>
  <p>While in the swamp, no creature can see beyond 30 feet without truesight. Every hour and once at the start of a combat encounter, creatures must roll Knowledge (Nature):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1-2: </b>Fall into a sinkhole. Drop to 0 AGI. Roll STR DC 15 to pull; three failures kill.</li>
    <li>3-8: </b>Bitten by a mosquito. Take 1d4 Nature/Toxin damage.</li>
    <li>9-12: </b>Notice a nearby methane vent. Any Fire spell going off nearby damages all creatures.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><p><b>Region - Canyons of Woe: </b>As the foothills of the north give way to an ever-shrinking land bridge, one will find their entryway into the southern continent to be through the maze-like barren land known as the Canyons of Woe. Infested with crag-nesting harpies and other hostile wildlife, one might wonder whether the eventual settlements of Angilrom they might encounter would be a respite or an even worse sight. A few human settlements from Southport dot the region, though travelers are not entirely safe until they reach the city proper beyond the canyons, which are prophetically shaped like a long series of hallways.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Eshran Desert: </b>The most infamous feature of the continent by far; a massive dune desert that stretches all the way from the southern reaches of the nation of Janubiya to the red and rocky badlands of Redrock. Bordered to the west by the steep Stonespine Mountains and in the east by the Gorranian nations and the South Seas, it is mostly a vast stretch of empty nothing where barely any creature can survive.</p>
  <p>Travel across the Eshran without knowing the intricate network of secret oases known to the natives by astrological orientation is guaranteed suicide. All creatures need to drink water equal to their racial hit die in liters per day, or suffer disadvantage on every single roll. Every hour spent under the sun reduces STR, CON, DEX and AGI by 1 point each incrementally. If a creature's CON modifier reaches -1 as a result of this, they suffer a heat stroke and go unconscious. Finding shade resets this timer over a period of 1 hour.</p>
  <p>Wiser travelers and the civilized stick to the ledge of the Stonespine as they cross southward for any reason. Titanic burrowing monsters, insectoid demons, furious elementals and djinni as well as bandits of every shape and size await the unwary, as well as the promise of hidden treasure and ruins of times when Abyssals still roamed the world.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Merchant's Isle: </b>A small pair of islands off the eastern coast of Southport. Known for its exotic fruit and dangerous pirate fortresses yet to be plumbed.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - South Seas: </b>The aquatic stretch that faces South Karra from the east. Contrasting the Sea of Man which faces Korak and Hylonia, the South Seas stretch from the Dagger Strait which leads into the Karran Sea and down to the bottom of the world. These waters are still completely infested with pirates, who are still very much active and surround the Thousand Isles region. Trade with the nation of Ryon is absolutely bustling, which invites enterprising adventurers and vultures alike to adventure.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Southern Mudhills: </b>Colloquial name for the stretch of badlands that surrounds the Ogre nations. A dreadful biome of uneven mesas and quicksand that offers a twisted respite compared to the murderous scorching emptiness of the desert. Also known as the "dreadlands", for they were once the home of an infamous Gorranian sorcerer-king.</p>
  <br><p><b>Region - Stonespine Mountains: </b>The mountain-peaks that stretch from the Canyons of Woe all the way down to the Mudhills, protecting the western half of the continent from the Eshran desert. The incredibly steep mountains, which are very difficult to cross, keep the winds from crossing to either side, leaving one half of the continent humid and swampy, and other dry and sandy. The mountains are known to be home for multitudes of leonine beastmen called the Leijon, who hunt in packs and enjoy pulling tricks on unsuspecting travelers.</p>
  <p>While walking the Stonespine mountains beyond the foothills, characters may have to roll d20 to face hostile winds that change every 4 hours on average and d8 for its direction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1-2: </b>Unusually calm.</li>
    <li>3-9: </b>Mild leaf-swaying winds. Movement is halved for every creature. Flying creatures and objects receive double speed instead if flying in the wind's direction.</li>
    <li>10-14: </b>Violent howling winds. In addition to the latter, every land creature must roll CON against DC 10 or fall down for one round.</li>
    <li>15-18: </b>Violent tree-bending winds. In addition to the latter, stability roll becomes DC 15. Failure blows away creatures 40 - CON feet in the wind's direction.</li>
    <li>19: </b>Flash windstorm. In addition to the latter, ranged attacks and flight become impossible for creatures smaller than Dragons. Stability roll becomes DC 20. Creatures must succeed in the roll to move against the direction of the wind.</li>
    <li>20: </b>Catastrophic hurricane. Flight becomes altogether impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><p><b>Region - Wailing Savanna: </b>In a triangular formation right between the mountains and the Canyons of Woe, a stretch of barren yellowed grassland dotted with the occasional canopy trees separates these areas from the sandy dunes. The steppes are home to many creatures; elephants, giraffes, monkeys, lions, zebras, and even tribes of beastmen such as Leijon, Loxodon and Centaurs, who live minimalistic lives as hunter-gatherers. Though the latter are capable of speech, they are extremely wary of outsiders, as everyone is in the south.</p>
  <p>A complicated chain of alliances and bitter feuds exist between the clans and even the races themselves; the Centaurs are locked in eternal war with the Minotaurs, the Leijon and Loxodon maintain a tenuous alliance in order to discourage the Gorranians and Orcs from splitting their forces and attempting to move up north. Nobody is at peace with the Dwarves.</p><br>
