<p> <b><center>ABJURATION - Protection</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Druidic Grove</b> - Abjuration, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>Using a sacred leaf of mistletoe harvested by a golden sickle under the light of a full moon, the caster takes 10 minutes to command a stretch of land 90 feet in diameter to transform. Man-made objects like buildings are unaffected, and this miracle for 24 hours or lasts until dispelled. While shaping the area, the caster can specify specific creatures or types as friends immune to negative effects of the grove. They can decide any stretch within the grove to be foggy, thorny, crawling with grasping vines, or violently windy. They may awaken up to 4 trees at once as obedient guardians that will never leave the grove, and last until the grove fades. To creatures immune to the effects of the grove, the wind and thorns are harmless.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Forbid*</b> - Abjuration, Holy</p>
 <p>Using 1,000 of powdered gems and a sprinkling of holy water, the caster takes a total of 10 minutes designating a 40,000 ftÂ² area of space (equivalent to 200 x 200 ft) with a height of 30 feet as completely immune to any kind of teleportation, shifting or blinking. No gates or portals can be opened in the area. Furthermore, the caster can choose any type of divine, extraplanar, elemental or unnatural beings to be divinely forbidden from entering the area, striking them with 5d10 Holy or Shadow damage (caster's choice) whenever they enter the area or start a turn within. Optionally, the caster may design a password which one of the forbidden creatures can speak to become immune to this specific damage.</p>
 <p>Forbidden areas cannot overlap, and each last 24 hours. The spell reagents are not consumed until the ward fades, meaning the caster can re-cast the miracle every day for 30 days to allow it to become permanent and last until dispelled.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>CONJURATION - Transportation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Divine Feast</b> - Conjuration, Holy OR Nature/Life</p>
 <p>By breaking an ornate golden bowl worth 1,000 gold full of royal jelly, the caster can bring forth an exquisite feast that can feed a number of creatures equal to the caster's level. The food is magnificent, tailored to the individual tastes of the group, and does not bloat or intoxicate. It takes one full hour to consume, after which all who partook without being interrupted are cured of all diseases, become immune to poison as well as fear or panic, and perform all STR, CON and WIS rolls at advantage for 12 hours.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Mark and Recall</b> - Conjuration, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>First, this spell can be used to designate a place a minimum of 10 feet wide across on each side as sanctuary, or to change the location of a previous one. If used while a sanctuary is chosen, the caster and up to five willing creatures physically touching one another teleport across existence to it.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Mycelium Network</b> - Conjuration, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster touches a plant of size Large or bigger, connecting it to any other plant on the same plane of existence somewhere they have been to once. For up to 10 minutes, any creature can step into the initial plant and exit from the destination plant.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Summon Planar Ally</b> - Conjuration, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster prays for the aid of their aligned planar ruler, who can choose to send one of their servants in temporary contract with the caster. The ensuing spirit is under no compulsion to do anything for the caster, will refuse suicidal tasks, and may even demand payment in exchange for services rendered. This demand may range from a donation of gold or magical items to its temple to a specific act like a sacrifice or murder, with its gravity depending on what the caster asks of it. If the caster's request aligns with the creature's alignment ethos or would further its ruler's aims, it won't ask for compensation.</p>
 <p>If the creature is enlisted into the caster's party, it'll stay for a maximum of 10 days.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Thorn Wall</b> - Conjuration, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster designates a stretch of ground up to 60 feet in total length, 10 feet in height and 5 feet thick to grow into a bunch of violently coiling thorny vines. This effect lasts up to 10 minutes or until the caster loses concentration, and blocks line of sight. Creatures entering the wall or ending a turn within must roll AGI or take 7d8 physical damage (half that much on a successful save.) Terrain within the wall is considered extra difficult and requires x4 as much movement. If this spell is cast at a higher slot level, damage increases by +1d8 for each level above the 6th.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>DIVINATION - Unnatural Sight</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Pathfinding</b> - Conjuration, Holy OR Nature</p>
 <p>Using 100 gp worth of divination tools (bones, sticks, dice, cards) the caster can mentally visualize the shortest path to a location of their choosing. The location must be fixed, on the same plane of existence, and uniquely specific. For up to 24 hours or until the caster loses concentration, they can tell the general direction of the location, how far it is, and what turns must be taken at each fork of the road to reach it.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Truesight</b> - Conjuration, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster grants a willing creature truesight, or the ability to see anything that is hidden or invisible, as well as spirits in the Ethereal Plane and the Shadow Realm. This lasts for 1 hour.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>EVOCATION - Energy Generation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Cure</b> - Evocation, Holy OR Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster lays their hand on a creature and chants for five turns, bathing them in a surge of positive energy that restores 70 health points, and cures them of any disease or loss of sense.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Sunblast</b> - Evocation, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster's hand begins to glow a bright sunlight orange that lights up a 30 foot radius area for up to 1 minute. They may use an action to blast a line of sunlight in a 5 foot wide beam that extends for 60 feet, forcing every creature caught within to roll CON or be blinded and take 6d8 Holy damage (successful save halves with no blind.) Undead and Abyssal creatures throw with disadvantage.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Wall of Blades</b> - Evocation, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster designates a stretch of ground up to 100 feet in total length and 20 feet in height to materialize into a wall of whirling sharp weapons. This effect lasts up to 10 minutes or until the caster loses concentration, and blocks line of sight. Creatures entering the wall or ending a turn within must roll AGI or take 6d10 physical damage (half that much on a successful save.) Terrain within the wall is considered extra difficult and requires x4 as much movement.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>NECROMANCY - Decay</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Aggrieve</b> - Necromancy, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster reaches for a creature they can see within 60 feet, forcing it to roll CON or take 14d6 Shadow damage (half as much on a successful save.) This spell cannot kill its target, and if it were to drop their health below 1, it simply returns to 1. If the victim fails the saving throw, their health point maximum is reduced by the damage taken for 1 hour, non-cumulatively, and any effect that cures disease reverts this.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Danse Macabre</b> - Necromancy, Shadow</p>
 <p>This spell can only be cast at night. Using a 150 gp black onyx for each target, the caster forces the corpse of three human-sized humanoids to rise as ghouls under their control. The caster can command the ensuing ghouls using a bonus action, so long as they're within 120 feet. The caster maintains control over the creatures for up to 24 hours, at which point they become completely catatonic and disobedient. Re-casting the spell while the creatures still stand reasserts control rather than bringing forth new ones.</p>
 <p>If cast at a higher slot level, this spell adds 1 more ghoul for each level above the 6th.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>TRANSMUTATION - Change</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Circle of Autumn</b> - Transmutation, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>The caster's body's surrounded by a tempest of violent razor winds for up to 10 minutes or until the caster loses concentration. Until the effect ends, the caster is resistant to ranged attacks, can fly at 60 feet per round, and can blast a 15 foot cube of wind in any location that deals 2d10 physical damage on a failed AGI save and pushes targets 10 feet away (half on success.)</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Circle of Spring</b> - Transmutation, Nature/Earth</p>
 <p>The caster's body is surrounded by a craggy shell of rock for up to 10 minutes or until the caster loses concentration. Until the effect ends, the caster is resistant to all physical attacks, can move through solid stone effortlessly at their normal running speed and without destabilizing it (but cannot end a turn within or are ejected) and can generate 15 foot radius earthquakes that force targets to roll AGI or fall prone.</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Circle of Summer</b> - Transmutation, Nature</p>
 <p>The caster's body bursts with flame that does not hurt them, lighting up a 30 foot radius for up to 10 minutes or until the caster loses concentration. Until the effect ends, the caster is completely immune to Fire damage and resistant to Frost damage, automatically deals 1d10 Fire damage to any nearby target, and can blast a 5 x 15 foot ray of flame that deals 4d8 Fire damage on a failed AGI save (half on success.)</p>
 <br><p><b>6 - Circle of Winter</b> - Transmutation, Nature</p>
 <p>The caster's body explodes with a roaring snowstorm for up to 10 minutes or until the caster loses concentration. Until the effect ends, the caster is completely immune to Frost damage and resistant to Fire damage, causes a 10 foot radius area around them to be difficult terrain, and can blast a 15 foot cone of blizzard that deals 4d6 Frost damage on a failed AGI save (half on success.)</p>
