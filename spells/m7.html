<h2><a href="mlist.html">Mage Spells</a> > Tier 7</h2>
<p> <b><center>ABJURATION - Protection</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Lesser Imprisonment</b> - Evocation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster forms an invisible, immobile cube-shaped prison roughly 20 feet wide around an area of their choice which lasts up to 1 hour. Any creatures that fit inside the prison can never leave except by magical means, and the prison blocks teleportation travel as well as movement across the Ethereal Plane through its walls, both of which require a successful CHA spell roll to bypass.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>CONJURATION - Transportation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Ascend</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>By ringing a small metal fork worth at least 250 gp attuned to a specific frequency, the caster and up to 8 willing creatures see their surroundings melt into a plane of existence of the caster's choosing. The location within that plane of existence is usually an area designed for such a purpose, such as a city gate.</p>
 <p>This spell can be used to banish an unwilling creature, which must roll a CHA save or be taken to a random plane of existence (or their home if extraplanar.)</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Magic Mansion</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a miniature ivory house, the caster chants for 1 minute and summons forth a glowing door up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. When entered, the door leads to a magnificent mansion of up to 50 different 10 x 10 foot wide areas (can be separate rooms or combined) of the caster's imagination. The mansion is furnished and stocked for food for up to 100 people, with a staff of 100 ghostly servants at their beck and call.</p>
 <p>The caster decides the appearance of the servants, the food, furnishings, wallpaper, etc. Servants can mend simple gear and objects, cook, clean, light fires and serve, but cannot leave the mansion. This spell lasts for up to 24 hours, expelling all non-servant beings inside to the nearest open space.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>ENCHANTMENT - Mind-Addling</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Writhe</b> - Enchantment, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster causes a creature with less than 100 health points to roll CON if it is not immune to being charmed. If it fails, its speed is capped to 10 feet per round, and they suffer disadvantage on everything except CON rolls. The effect lasts for up to one minute, allowing the victim to roll CON every turn to try to break out of the effect.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>EVOCATION - Energy Generation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Bifurcated Helix</b> - Evocation, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>The caster forces two bursts of wind to rotate against one another, coalescing a violent 20 foot wide and 30 foot tall cyclone which forces every Ogre-sized or smaller creature caught within to roll STR or be sucked up in the air. This spell lasts up to 1 minute while the caster maintains concentration. While inside, creatures take 10d6 physical damage (successful save halves), cannot perform STR or AGI saves, and are lifted 5 more feet in the air. When the spell ends, creatures are ejected 20 feet in random directions.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Casket of Stars</b> - Evocation, Arcane</p>
 <p>A whirling bundle of wisps emanate from the caster's fingertips, condensing into a singular bead-like point within range for up to 1 minute provided the caster maintains concentration. When the effect ends, the bead expands violently into an explosion of searing fire 40 feet wide, forcing creatures to roll AGI or take damage depending on how long the effect was delayed. The initial value is 12d6, but each turn increases its damage by a further +1d6. If a creature touches the bead prematurely, they get to roll AGI to throw it somewhere else up to 40 feet and if they fail, it explodes immediately.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Chaos Splash</b> - Evocation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster extends their hands, causing a multicolored rainbow blast to erupt from their palm and strike every target that can see in a 60 foot cone in front of them. Each creature must roll AGI and take damage of a random type (successful save halves and nullifies debuffs) decided using a d8 roll: </b>Fire, Frost, Shadow, Nature/Air, Nature/Toxin or take no damage and be banished home/to a random plane of existence.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Flying Mageblade</b> - Evocation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster throws a miniature platinum pommel worth 250 gp in the air, growing it into a flying sword that manifests a glowing laser blade. For up to 1 minute provided the caster maintains concentration, they can use a bonus action to command the sword to move 20 feet in any direction and/or strike a target within 5 feet of it for 3d10 Arcane damage.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Whirling Ebonpyre</b> - Evocation, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster raises their hands to the air, commanding ten 10 foot wide cyclones of pure raging fire to blast to the ground. Any creature caught in one must roll AGI or take 7d10 Fire damage (halved on save.) The caster can choose certain types of objects to be immune from the heat of the fire.</p>
  <br><p> <b><center>ILLUSION - False Sensation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Greater Mirage</b> - Illusion, Nature</p>
 <p>This spell is identical to the 4th level spell lesser mirage, except it lasts for 10 days up to 1 mile, and can also fool victims physically. It can make terrain difficult, and the ruse is only uncovered by truesight.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Project Image</b> - Illusion, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster projects an illusory version of themselves that can move up to twice their speed anywhere up to 500 miles they can see. The caster can make the image do anything the caster can do, but to no physical or magical effect, as the image is merely an intangible illusion.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Semiclone</b> - Illusion, Arcane</p>
 <p>By forming an effigy of a target the caster is familiar with using snow, ice, stone or mud and infusing it with 1,500 gp of powdered rubies and a piece of the target's body, the caster can creature a believable simulacrum of a beast or humanoid within range. The process takes up to 12 hours, and the resulting clone is formed naked with the same statistics but half the target's maximum health points. The clone is friendly and obeys every command given to it but, due to being a soulless construct, does not feel the effects of any healing spell or mind-addling and will never regenerate health, mana or spell slots.</p>
 <p>The caster can repair a damaged clone using 100 gp per hit point of rare herbs and minerals, or re-cast the spell to immediately destroy the old clone.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>NECROMANCY - Decay</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Soul Lash</b> - Necromancy, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster forms an illusory whip of negative energy in their hand that can be used in the same round to whip a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to roll CON or take 30+7d8 in Shadow damage (successful save halves.) If the spell kills the target, it rises as a zombie permanently under the caster's command.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>TRANSMUTATION - Change</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Ethereal Shift</b> - Transmutation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster steps into the Ethereal plane, gaining the ability to move like a ghost at half speed through all objects except the natural ground. The caster remains there for up to 8 hours or until they dismiss the spell. Everything looks gray and foggy in the Ethereal realm, and the caster can't see for more than 60 feet in any direction. While on the Ethereal Plane, nothing on the material world can influence, perceive or interact with them. When the spell ends, the caster materializes on the material world positional equivalent of wherever they were on the Ethereal Plane. If cast at a higher slot level, this spell can target up to 3 more people within 10 feet for each slot level above the 7th.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Reverse Gravity</b> - Transmutation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster selects a 100 foot wide and 100 foot tall area within sight to reverse gravity in. All creatures and objects in the area not anchored to the ground fall upward and bob softly when they reach the top. If there are objects in the area to be held onto, each creature may roll AGI to try to hold on. If there is some kind of ceiling in range, creatures suffer damage as if they had fallen that far.</p>
 <br><p><b>7 - Stasis</b> - Transmutation, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a piece of amber and 5,000 gp worth of powdered jewelry, the caster selects a creature or object to hide out of existence temporarily. The caster touches the target, rendering it invisible and completely undetectable by any kind of Divination spell besides truesight. If the target is a creature, it languishes in suspended animation without aging or feeling the passage of time. The effect can be dispelled early, but the caster must set a condition which will cause it to eventually. The condition can be anything which occurs within 1 mile of the target, such as the passage of a number of years, a specific spell being cast, or the presence of a specific creature. The target is also awoken early if they take damage.</p>
