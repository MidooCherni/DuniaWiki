<p>Carefree and jolly little merrymakers with a love of life that takes them to the oddest corners of the world. Half-foots, also known as Halflings or Hobbits, are of somewhat smaller stature than Dwarves, with much less hair and brawn. They could easily be confused for human children if not for the fact their faces and skin aged visibly to match. They are about 3-4 feet tall.
