<h2><a href="mlist.html">Priest Miracles</a> > Tier IX</h2>
<p> <b><center>ABJURATION - Protection</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Flawless Clothing of the Celestials</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using a small sheet of woven adamantium, the caster gains total immunity from all forms of damage for up to 10 minutes or until their concentration is broken.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>CONJURATION - Transportation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Planar Gate</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>By using a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp, the caster summons forth a 20 foot gate to a plane of existence they can think of, within the vicinity of a being of great power. The being is compelled to walk in through the gate, but their ensuing reaction is completely up to them. Typically, calling powerful beings for trifling matters results in a negative reaction, while an allied caster beseeching them for aid in an urgent matter of appropriate magnitude will result in an extraordinarily powerful ally. At the end of the effect, the being may or may not demand compensation, depending on the circumstance.</p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Red Miles</b> - Conjuration, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster holds their hand aloft, causing a violent eruption of red plasma to lash out of the back of their palm and spread uncontrollably in a 360 foot radius around them. Root-like tendrils extend rapidly, causing every creature in the area up to 200 feet in the air to roll CON or take 2d6 physical damage and be incapacitated by the coiling veins. For each round as long as the caster maintains concentration, the veins mimic the fissure-cracking effects of the 8th tier spell earthquake, and the caster may command the miles to impale up to 6 separate targets, which roll AGI or take 10d6 physical damage (successful save halves.)</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>DIVINATION - Unnatural Sight</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Foretell</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster touches a target for up to 1 minute, granting them the ability to sense their own demise instinctively for up to 8 hours. They can no longer be surprised, gain advantage on all rolls, and every attack against them has disadvantage. This spell does not require concentration.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>ENCHANTMENT - Mind-Addling</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Writ of Fate: </b>Death</b> - Enchantment, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster utters a secret word tied to the metaphysical nature of the death of the cosmos which immediately kills any target with 100 health points or less.</p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Writ of Fate: </b>Life</b> - Enchantment, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster whispers a secret word tied to the metaphysical nature of the genesis of the cosmos which returns the target to its maximum hit points, and clears the effect of any and all mind-addling. This spell has no effect on constructs and the undead.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>EVOCATION - Energy Generation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Complete Healing</b> - Evocation, Holy</p>
 <p>The caster floods a 60 foot radius area with healing energy, restoring a total of 700 health points divided among any number of chosen targets. Creatures healing by this effect are also cured of all disease and loss of sense. This spell has no effect on constructs or the undead.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>NECROMANCY - Decay</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Astral Projection</b> - Necromancy, Holy</p>
 <p>By tying themselves and willing creatures in 1,000 gp of spun adamantine yarn each, the caster and their allies can slip their bodies into a suspended animation that requires no sustenance and project themselves into the Astral Sea. This infinite stretch of colorful interstellar nebulae separates the Light from the Abyss and within it are contained bubbles which lead to all the planes. The initial ritual takes 1 hour to perform, and allows creatures to project indefinitely until they return or a dispel is cast.</p>
 <p>An intangible spirit thread extends from behind the necks of each participant, visible for 1 foot and then disappearing into intangibility. Nothing can tear it save for effects that are openly stated to, but if severed, the creature's soul and body are separated and they die.</p>
 <p>The creatures' astral bodies are identical to their physical bodies, including anything they were wearing and carrying at the time of their projection. They can travel across space and through shortcut portals set up and used by interstellar beings. If a projected creature swims back to the material plane or dies while in the Astral Sea, they reawake as if from a bad dream. If they swim to a planar bubble foreign to the one they projected in, their real body is teleported all the way across the spirit thread to their destination plane, merging with their soul, and they fall from the sky into that plane.</p>
 <br><p><b>9 - Writ of Fate: </b>Conditional Immortality</b> - Necromancy, Holy</p>
 <p>Using a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth 25,000 gp, the caster possibly safeguards its target from its next death. An aligned creature's death is considered either just or heroic if they are slain by a creature of equal or higher level and opposite alignment; Lawful slaying Chaotic or Good slaying Evil is considered a just death, while the opposite is considered a heroic death. If the death is neither just nor heroic, the creature rises again after an hour with full health and no hampering or mind-addling effects of any kind. If their body is gone, a new body materializes by the caster who initially cast this spell.</p>
 <p>Alternatively, the caster can lay their hand on the corpse of someone who has died less than 200 years ago of a neither just nor heroic death, or speak their name while thinking of them, and resurrect them.</p>
