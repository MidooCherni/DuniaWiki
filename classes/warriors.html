<h2><a href="../classes.html">Classes</a> > Warriors</h2>
<center><img src="warban.jpg" style="width:70%"></center><br>
<p>Spontaneous martial artists motivated by self-interest, whose combat styles originate from their personality and individual studies. A warrior is someone who perfects the art of combat without the aid of the divine or any other religious organization, relying fully on whatever capacities they can push out of their own bodies to practice fighting techniques and grow their own endurance.</p>
  <p>Instead of being endowed with some mystical gift from the outer planes, they are individuals who synthesize their own powers by themselves by comprehending the physical laws of the world and figuring out how to harness them. All Warriors are weapons-trained and suffer no melee penalties from lack of skill.</p>
  <p><b>Fighters</b>, <b>Barbarians</b>, <b>Monks</b> and <b>Hexblades</b> can be referred to as Warriors. They get to choose 1 new talent at levels 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 19, but may not exceed 20 in any stat this way until after level 20. Warriors are granted the maximum racial value on added health points every time they level up instead of having to roll, and add their level (diminishingly) to each attack (100%/75%/50%/25%)</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 1:</b> Warriors gain the ability to <em>Kick</em> as a reaction, interrupting spellcasting.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 3:</b> Warriors gain the ability to <em>Bash</em> every odd combat turn instead of attacking, which rolls STR modifier against the enemy's CON, and if successful it skips their next turn and bars them from reacting. Targets with CON above 18 are immune.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 5:</b> Warriors gain the ability to <em>Cleave</em> targets, dividing damage across any chosen number of targets in melee range. If a main action strike kills a target, they may expend a bonus action to strike again. They may also <em>doublestrike</em> every time they take a basic attack command, hitting twice instead of just once.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 7:</b> Warriors may specialize in one of the following: <i>Great-Weapon Fighting</i> to gain +2 to accuracy when wielding a two-handed weapon, <i>Dual-Wielding</i> to remove the off-hand accuracy penalty, or <i>Dueling</i> to attack as a bonus action with -2 accuracy penalty if wielding a one-handed weapon.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 9:</b> Warriors who aren't attacked for 1 turn can gain a <em>Second Wind</em> once per day, (twice at 15, and three times at 20) rolling 1d4 times level in self-healing.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 11:</b> Warriors gain a further +2 to accuracy rolls in their specialized fighting style, the ability to <em>critically strike</em> on an accuracy score of 17 or higher. Their <em>doublestrike</em> is also upgraded to triplestrike.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 13:</b> Warriors gain the ability to <em>Disarm</em> an opponent by rolling <em>d20 vs 10 + enemy level</em>. The weapon falls to the ground, where anyone may attempt to pick it up next round.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 15:</b> Warriors may immediately <em>Riposte</em> a failed attack against them, rolling for another attack that does not consume a turn once per combat round.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 17:</b> Warriors gain the ability to slip into a <em>Battle Trance</em> once per day for 1 round per 3 character levels, becoming immune to fear, charm or stuns. During a battle trance, all hits dealt and received are critical strikes, and the Warrior loses the ability to perform DEX and INT skills. Their ability to multistrike is also upgraded into a quadstrike every attack.</p>
  <p>        <b>Level 19:</b> Warriors perfect the ultimate <em>Combat Instinct</em>- a defensive stance that allows them to block and riposte every incoming attack. This ability shares its duration and cooldown period with Battle Trance.</p>
