<h2>What's new in DUNIA?</h2>
<p>Coming from D&D or Pathfinder? Here's a complete list of all the things in DUNIA that are explicitly different:</p>
<div style="padding:20px;">
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="attributes.html" style="color:brown;">Agility</a> (AGI) stat is used to dodge attacks instead of AC. It didn't make sense to me an armored behemoth and a flighty little monk used the same mechanic for damage mitigation.</li>
    <li><em>"Armor"</em> instead reduces physical damage taken. You will be able to hit a slow, lumbering target, it's just not guaranteed you'll be hurting them.</li>
    <li><em>Dexterity</em> (DEX) modifies ALL attack chance rolls. Now you can be strong and clumsy, or a venomous little snake- rejoice! </li>
    <li>Playable races have <a href="needs.html" style="color:brown;">different dietary needs</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="exp.html" style="color:brown;">Experience points</a> are simplified.</li>
    <li><a href="../classes.html" style="color:brown;">30 playable classes</a>, including non-combat civilians.</li>
    <li>Cantrips are gone, as they trivialized survival and made magic feel petty and ubiquitous. Mages aren't superhuman; bending reality is a tiring and unique process that should be saved up for when you're REALLY in a bind.</li>
    <li>Different spells, with many new additions.</li>
    <li>A <a href="../lore/history.html" style="color:brown;">unique world</a> inspired not just by the Forgotten Realms, but by other great media as well, such as Homestuck and Touhou.</li>
    <li>A different <a href="../bestiary/creatures.html" style="color:brown;">creature classification system</a>.</li> 
    <li>Optional <a href="../appendix/dungeons.html" style="color:brown;">procedurally generated side dungeons</a> with loot formulas to make money and power up.</li>
    <li><a href="../appendix/land.html" style="color:brown;">Player housing</a>.</li>
  </ul>
