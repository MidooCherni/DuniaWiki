<br><h2><a href="creatures.html">Bestiary</a> > Constructs</h2>
<p>Machines brought to life through the power of clockwork and energy. Constructs are characterized by the fact they mimic intelligence rather than being innately endowed with it. They have no free will, sense of self-preservation or independent thought beyond what is instructed to them, and are only animated to fulfill directives programmed by their master.</p>
<p>Constructs are inorganic, and thus cannot be healed, and are immune to Holy, Shadow and Enchantment magic.</p><br>
