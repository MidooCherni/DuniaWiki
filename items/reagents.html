<p><b>Magic Shops:</b> In any large enough town, a magic shop will be available from which a spellcaster can commission the creation of two spell scrolls they can cast. This process takes 100gp per spell, and the next day the spell scrolls will be available for the spellcaster to write into their spellbook. Reagents can also be bought at any magic shop.</p><br>
