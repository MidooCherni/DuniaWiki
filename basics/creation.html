<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p><b>To Begin: </b>Everyone starts by choosing a race and naming their character. Optionally they can provide the character with a backstory.</p>
<p><b>Option A - Quick: </b>If you don't have a concrete idea for what character you want to make, you can roll a 3d8 eight times (one for each of the attributes, and an extra to discard) and decide which attribute gets what. Afterwards, you add racial bonuses.</p>
<p><b>Option B - Build: </b></Option>Otherwise, you can begin with 8 points in every stat, then distribute a total of extra 8 points across all stats, as well as reduce stats if needed to gain more points to distribute elsewhere. Afterwards, you add racial bonuses.</p>
<p>Stats cannot exceed 18 or go below 3 at character creation without racial modifiers.</p>
<p>After creating a character, you choose a class. Some classes have requirements, others don't-- if the class' info block doesn't explicitly list a requirement you lack, you can choose it.</p>
