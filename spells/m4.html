<h2><a href="mlist.html">Mage Spells</a> > Tier 4</h2>
<p> <b><center>ABJURATION - Protection</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Banish</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster concentrates on a target they can see, sending them to the Shadow Realm (or to the Ethereal Plane if evil-aligned) where they can harm no one. If the victim is an extraplanar creature, they immediately return to their home plane. If the caster breaks concentration before the effect ends, the target returns. If cast at a higher slot level, this spell targets 1 more creature per slot level above the 4th.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Magical Privacy</b> - Abjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using powdered chrysolite worth 50 gp, the caster renders an indoor area no larger than 100 feet on any side in total immune to all forms of observation through Divination, sound-proofed, totally opaque from the outside and unable to be the destination or source of any teleportation spell. If cast at a higher level, the maximum room size grows further by 100 feet on each side for each slot level above the 4th.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Stoneskin</b> - Abjuration, Nature/Earth</p>
 <p>Using diamond dust worth 100 gp, the caster turns the skin of the target into flexible stone. They can move freely but gain resistance to all kinds of physical damage.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>CONJURATION - Transportation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Dimensional Pocket</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>Using an ornate, jeweled box the size of their palm worth 5000 gp, the caster can open and close a floating rift to an alternate storage pocket dimension shaped like a 3x2x2 foot chest.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Warp</b> - Conjuration, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster attempts to bend space to warp themselves somewhere they can visualize or verbally describe using distance and direction. They can take one willing creature with them by touching them, both not above their maximum natural carrying capacity. If there is already something occupying the location the caster attempts to warp to, the spell fails, returning them to their original location and dealing 4d6 damage.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>DIVINATION - Unnatural Sight</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Mage Eye</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster summons a floating eye the size of a fist that persists for up to 1 hour and allows them to receive visual information. The eye has darkvision, can look in every direction and moves up to 30 feet per round. It cannot cross planes, and is blocked by collision, but can squeeze through 1 inch openings.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Find Creature</b> - Divination, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster thinks of a creature familiar to them in their mind's eye. They can sense the direction of the creature's location as long as it is within 1 mile. If the creature is moving, the caster can sense the direction and speed. If the creature is polymorphed, it is immune from detection. If a body of water at least 10 feet in thickness comes between the caster and their target, the spell fails to detect them.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>ENCHANTMENT - Mind-Addling</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Charm Creature</b> - Enchantment, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster wriggles their fingers, forcing a creature to roll WIS (at advantage if it's currently locked in combat) or become charmed for up to 1 hour or until one of its new allies attacks it. A charmed creature is friendly to the caster, but at the end of the spell it is fully aware it was charmed and remembers everything. If this spell is cast at a higher level spell slot, it can target one more character pet slot level above the 4th.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Confusion</b> - Enchantment, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>The caster blasts the minds of every creature in a 10 foot radius, causing temporary concussions if they fail WIS saves. Confused creatures cannot perform reactions, and roll a d6 every round to determine their next action, after which they can try to roll WIS again to attempt to snap awake:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>1-3: </b>Nothing</li>
  <li>4-5: </b>The creature rolls a d8 and moves in the ensuing cardinal direction</li>
  <li>6: </b>The creature attacks a random target within reach, if there are any</li>
 </ul>
 <br><p> <b><center>EVOCATION - Energy Generation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Ball Lightning</b> - Evocation, Nature/Air</p>
 <p>The caster forms a flying ball of electricity that lingers in the air for up to 1 minute as long as they maintain concentration. The ball spins, forming a sphere of dark wind around it, causing a space of 40 feet in diameter around it to become difficult terrain and forcing creatures within to roll STR or take 2d6 physical damage per turn. Every turn until the end of the effect, the caster may spend a bonus action to cause the ball to strike a nearby victim within the sphere for 4d6 Nature/Air damage. If this spell is cast at a higher slot level, damage increases by +1d6 for each slot level above the 4th.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Force Bubble</b> - Evocation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster targets a creature within 30 feet of them of size Large or smaller and causes a sphere of solid magic to form around them. An unwilling creature must roll AGI. Absolutely nothing can enter or leave the sphere; objects, magical energy or anything. The sphere is weightless and immune to all damage, but it can be picked up or moved by rolling. A disintegrate effect destroys it without harming anything inside.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Hailstorm</b> - Evocation, Frost</p>
 <p>The caster covers a 40 foot wide area in rumbling storm clouds that proceed to rain rock-like balls of hail on every creature within. Victims must roll AGI or take 3d6 physical and 3d6 Frost damage per turn with successful saves reducing the damage by half. Terrain within is difficult until the caster's next turn. If cast at a higher slot level, the physical damage is increased by +1d6 for each level above the 4th.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Thermal Shield</b> - Evocation, Fire OR Frost</p>
 <p>The caster summons a globe of flames or icy wind (their choice) that whirls violently around them for up to 10 minutes or until dismissed. Fire grants the caster resistance to Frost and vice versa. Whenever a creature attacks the caster in melee, the shield explodes dealing 2d8 damage of the appropriate element.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Wall of Fire</b> - Evocation, Fire</p>
 <p>The caster selects a stretch of ground that extends up to 20 feet in any shape, causing a burst of flame to erupt up to 20 feet in the air, forming a barrier 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque, and lasts for up to 1 minute with concentration. The caster can select any side of the wall to blast creatures within 10 feet of with 5d8 Fire damage (half as much on a successful AGI save.) At a higher slot level, damage increases by +1d8 for each level above the 4th.</p>
  <br><p> <b><center>ILLUSION - False Sensation</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Lesser Mirage</b> - Illusion, Nature</p>
 <p>After chanting for 10 minutes, the caster chooses a 150 foot stretch of ground to distort into the look, smell and sound of a different kind of terrain. With this spell, an open road can be made to look like a swamp, or a hill, or something else. A pond can be made to look like a stretch of grass, or a dune can be made to look like an oasis. Unnatural things like manufactured structures and objects aren't affected. Creatures that walk into the distorted area immediately uncover the ruse, seeing the original form of the terrain superimposed under the phantasm. This spell lasts for up to 24 hours after casting.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Persistent Invisibility</b> - Illusion, Shadow</p>
 <p>The caster or a creature they can touch becomes invisible for up to 1 minute, provided the caster maintains control. Anything they're carrying or wearing also becomes invisible. This spell is not broken by action. If this spell is cast at a higher slot level, the caster can target 1 more creature per level above 4th.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>NECROMANCY - Decay</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Dessicate</b> - Necromancy, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster saps moisture from a target, dealing 6d8 Shadow damage (half as much on a CON save.) If cast at a higher slot level, damage increases by +1d8 for each level above 4th.</p>
 <br><p> <b><center>TRANSMUTATION - Change</center></b></p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Control Earth</b> - Transmutation, Nature/Earth</p>
 <p>The caster gains control of a mass of stone up to a 100 foot cube for up to 10 minutes provided the caster maintains concentration. As an action, the caster may reshape the rock or wall or the like to reshape, like changing its appearance or shaping into a doorway or an alcove. This spell allows the caster to form rock contraptions, though no more complex than something like a hinge or a latch.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Control Water</b> - Transmutation, Nature/Water</p>
 <p>The caster gains control of any body of water up to a 100 foot cube for up to 10 minutes provided the caster maintains concentration. As an action, the caster may perform actions like raise its level by 20 feet (flooding any shore if needed), gather an enormous crashing wave up to 20 foot tall, part it for the rest of the duration, redirect its flow in any direction, or cause it to whirlpool into a sucking vortex.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Crafting</b> - Transmutation, Arcane</p>
 <p>The caster visualizes the process of making a non-magical object out of raw materials up to 10 feet large in any direction, causing it and the ingredients to fly up in the air and morph into the object's final form over 10 minutes. For example a bridge, a length of rope or clothes can be crafted. Objects that require high precision or extreme conditions to make such as jewelry, weapons and armor cannot be made.</p>
 <br><p><b>4 - Polymorph</b> - Transmutation, Nature/Life</p>
 <p>The caster forces a living or undead creature that isn't a shapechanger to roll WIS or contort into the shape of a creature of equal level or weaker. This effect lasts for up to 1 hour provided the caster maintains concentration. All the equipment snugly worn by the creature melds into its new form. It retains its alignment and personality, but all its stats including mental change to that of its new form. It loses or gains the ability to speak, use limbs, fly, breathe fire, etc. and reverts to its original form once it reaches 0 hit points or dies.</p>
