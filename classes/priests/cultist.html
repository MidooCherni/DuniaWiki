<img src="cultist.jpg" class="racepic" style="width:31%">
<p>Non-Good only. Also known as Fanatic or Acolyte. A living channel of the primal forces of the lower planes that seek to seep into and devour the world. They all speak Abyssal to some degree.</p>
  <p>Cultists swear allegiance to the dark cancer that throbs at the bottom of the universe, seeking to bind themselves to it and trade their souls in exchange for the boundless power it promises. They almost always show signs of deep-set insanity and mental disturbance, and are usually part of a group of other Cultists who scheme together to advance their cause. They are selfish though highly methodical, preferring to prey on the weak and cripple their targets using psychological exploitation.</p>
  <p>Cultists can immediately sense and read the minds of any frightened creature. When casting a Holy spell, the Cultist casts a corrupted Shadow version which achieves the same effect, but radiates energy from their chosen plane.</p>
  <p><b>Level 1: </b>Cultists may cause a target to <em>hallucinate</em>. This influences one target per 3 levels, and is a version of the fear spell which lasts up to 1 hour if not interrupted.</p>
  <p><b>Level 3: </b>Cultists can attempt to <em>control the wicked</em>, forcing an archetype vulnerable to them to roll WIS versus DC 10 + the Cultist's CHA modifier or become charmed for 1 hour.</p>
  <p><b>Level 5: </b>The Cultist begins to <em>evolve</em> into a creature more appropriate for their allegiance, twisting and growing new body parts if necessary. This causes every creature within melee range (including their party) to roll WIS versus DC the Cultist's level or lose a turn. The Cultist cannot turn this effect off until they evolve the ability at level 10.</p>
  <p><b>Level 10: </b>Cultists can <em>shapeshift</em> to and from their old mortal form, and choose which being to see either at a time. Their control ability is upgraded to <em>direct mind control</em>.</p>
  <p><b>Level 15: </b>Cultists may sacrifice a living being to <em>cause a catastrophe</em> without expending a spell slot. This ability casts a high level spell appropriate to their alignment that's harmful to everything and everyone except a Cultist in their true form, with the same penalties as Bishop.</p>
  <p>On character creation, a Cultist may be a cleric of one of the following forces:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Cleric of Boundaries: </b>Called <b>Youkai</b>. A guardian of Limbo who makes use of reality tearing gaps to invoke the apocalypse. Their aligned archetype is any frost creature, and their catastrophe is a version of the spell <i>reckoning</i> which can use any object as a substitute for meteors- a rain of falling swords, a fleet of boats, or even trains.</li>
    <li><b>Cleric of Decay: </b>Called <b>Doomsayer</b>. A wicked herald of the Plane of Rot and Shadow who spreads the foul word of Archpriest Garn'khil. Their aligned archetype is demons and the undead. Their catastrophe is the spell <i>animate dead</i> cast at the 10th level.</li>
    <li><b>Cleric of Rage: </b>Called <b>Hellpriest</b>. A wrathful servant of the plane in which hate and loathing are natural forces. Frequently called on by those with pure ire in their heart, their aligned archetype is any fire creature. Their catastrophe is the spell <i>red miles</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Cleric of Mischief: </b>Called <b>Honkifex</b> or Clownpriest. An utterly insane servant of the Plane of Dreams and Mischief dedicated to spreading the sadistic joy of trickery across the universe. Their aligned archetype is any Shadow creature. Their catastrophe is the spell <i>midnight calliope</i>. They can never be of any alignment other than Chaotic.</li>
